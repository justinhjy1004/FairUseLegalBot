31.
Defendant admits that Plaintiff demands a trial by jury.  Denies that any of the claims

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 
Without any admission as to burden of proof and expressly reserving their right to assert any 
additional defense or counterclaims that discovery may reveal, Defendant states the following 
defenses: 
1.
Although Plaintiff has named New Tang Dynasty Television, Inc. (NTD TV, Inc.) as 
Defendant in this lawsuit, NTD TV, Inc. is not the correct Defendant because NTD TV, Inc. is a 
defunct entity.  NTD TV, Inc. does no business, it transmits no content, and publishes no material 
online or in print.  NTD TV, Inc. did not publish the article hosted at the following URL: 
https://www.ntd.com/nypd-saves-injured-hawk-struck-in-the-middle-of-brooklyn-
traffic_282249.html.  Accordingly, NTD TV, Inc. was improperly named as a defendant in this 
lawsuit.   
2.
Defendant’s alleged use of Plaintiff’s allegedly copyrighted works is non-infringing 
fair use under 17 U.S.C. §107 because the allegedly copyrighted works were used for the purposes of 
news reporting, the use was transformative, and the entity that did publish the article at the URL 
listed above is a non-profit entity.  The allegedly copyrighted works in question are factual in nature 
and were published prior to any use by Defendant.  Defendant used an appropriate amount of the 
Case 1:19-cv-05170-JMF     Document 23     Filed 07/30/19     Page 7 of 11
8 
allegedly copyrighted work for the purpose of news reporting, and Defendant’s use caused no harm 
to the market for the copyrighted work.   
3.
Plaintiff’s allegedly copyrighted works lack the modicum of originality necessary for 
copyright protection and consequently they are not sufficiently original or creative to constitute 
copyrightable works, and/or the photographs shown in Exhibit A were placed in the public domain 
when they were published without notice on January 24, 2019.   
4.
Plaintiff does not have standing to bring a copyright infringement claim because he is 
not the author, an owner, or an exclusive licensee of Copyright Registration No. VA0002144517.   
5.
Plaintiff's copyright infringement claims are barred because one or more of Plaintiff's 
copyright registrations are invalid as a result of Plaintiff's knowing failure to disclose material facts 
to the U.S. Copyright Office.  But for Plaintiff's omission of these material facts from its copyright 
application, the Copyright Office would have rejected Plaintiff's application for lack of 
copyrightability and/or because Plaintiff is not the author and/or owner of Copyright Registration 
No. VA0002144517.   
6.
Plaintiff failed to advise the Copyright Office of facts that might have occasioned a 
rejection of the application, and as such, Plaintiff’s claims and requested remedies are barred by the 
doctrine of unclean hands.   
7.
Plaintiff has failed to obtain a valid copyright registration prior to filing the 
Complaint, and consequently, Plaintiff is not entitled to recover statutory damages and/or attorneys’ 
fees because Plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of 17 U.S.C. § 412.   
8.
Should Defendant be found to have infringed any copyrighted work and should this 
Court find that statutory damages are awardable, Plaintiff is not entitled to recover enhanced or 
Case 1:19-cv-05170-JMF     Document 23     Filed 07/30/19     Page 8 of 11
9 
punitive damages because any such infringing conduct was not willful, in that Defendant did not 
know that its conduct constituted copyright infringement.   
9.
Should Defendant be found to have infringed any copyrighted work and should this 
Court find that statutory damages are awardable, this Court should reduce the award of statutory 
damages to $200 because any infringement was innocent in that Defendant conducted itself under a 
good faith belief at all times that its conduct was innocent and this belief was reasonable under the 
circumstances.  
10.
Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief, as Plaintiff has no irreparable injuries. 
11.
Defendant reserves any and all additional defenses available to it in law or equity, 
now existing or later arising, as may be discovered.   
DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 
Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant demands a trial 
by jury on all affirmative defenses and any issues triable to a jury. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
Defendant prays for relief and requests that the Court: 
1.
Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint in its entirety, with prejudice; 
2.
Enter judgment in Defendants' favor on all counts of the First Amended Complaint;  
3.
Declare that Plaintiff's asserted copyright in the Photographs is invalid; 
4.
Order Plaintiff to cancel Copyright Reg. No. VA0002144517 by submitting a   
written voluntary cancellation request to the U.S. Copyright Office using the procedure described in 
Section 1807.4(E) of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices; 
5.
Deny Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief; 
6.
Deny Plaintiff's request for monetary relief; 
Case 1:19-cv-05170-JMF     Document 23     Filed 07/30/19     Page 9 of 11

7.
Award Defendants their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, under17 U.S.C. § 505 or 
otherwise; and 
8.
Any further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 
In further answer to the allegations made by NFPA in the Complaint, UpCodes 
asserts the following affirmative defenses.  UpCodes does not concede that it has the 
burden of proof on the defenses listed below: 
FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
The Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
Some or all of the material in which NFPA claims copyright is in the public 
domain, or otherwise not infringed, because it is the law. 
THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
NFPA’s claims of copyright infringement are barred or limited by the doctrine of 
merger. 
FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
NFPA’s claims of copyright infringement are barred or limited by the 
idea/expression dichotomy. 
FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
NFPA’s claims of copyright infringement are barred or limited because the material 
in which NFPA claims copyright constitutes “scenes a faire.” 
SIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
NFPA’s claims of copyright infringement are barred or limited by the government 
edicts doctrine.

SEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
NFPA does not own copyright in the material in which NFPA claims copyright 
because that material was authored in whole or in part by third parties. 
EIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
To the extent there is copying of copyrightable expression, that copying is de 
minimis. 
NINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
To the extent there is copying of copyrightable expression, that copying constitutes 
fair use.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
6. 
UpCodes operates the UpCodes service, located at https://up.codes.  
7. 
UpCodes was founded to make it easier for both industry professionals and 
laypeople to understand how to comply with state and local building codes. 
8. 
UpCodes allows its users to search for relevant building codes and other 
relevant laws on a per-jurisdiction basis. 
9. 
UpCodes shows its users an integrated view of the law.  It presents the law as 
adopted by particular jurisdictions, including amendments or modifications to model 
codes that jurisdictions have chosen to adopt. 
10. 
UpCodes does not publish model codes.  Some jurisdictions adopt model 
codes as the law without making any amendments to the text, and so the substance of 
certain jurisdictions’ codes may be identical to the model codes that they adopted. 
11. 
UpCodes does not require visitors to its website to register for an UpCodes 
account in order to view any of the available laws. 
12. 
UpCodes does not charge money for access to any of the available laws. 
13. 
UpCodes allows all users to copy and paste sections of the law, as well as 
print the law out. 
14. 
UpCodes is the only place, online or offline, where someone can access the 
integrated text, including local amendments and modifications, of many of the laws 
available on UpCodes.

15. 
UpCodes offers a subscription service with additional features and 
collaboration tools.  These include allowing users to compare codes of different 
jurisdictions, and to search across multiple codes in a particular jurisdiction. 
16. 
Some materials accessible on UpCodes also appears in one or more NFPA 
publications.  This material is referred to herein as the “Posted Laws.”  All of this material 
carries the force of law in one or more jurisdictions. 
17. 
At least one purpose for which the Posted Laws were created was for 
incorporation into law. 
18. 
NFPA made affirmative efforts to encourage one or more jurisdictions to 
incorporate the Posted Laws into the laws of that jurisdiction. 
19. 
The Posted Laws were incorporated into law in one or more jurisdictions. 
20. 
The Posted Laws are laws of general applicability in one or more 
jurisdictions. 
21. 
One or more jurisdictions impose criminal penalties for violating the 
requirements of the Posted Laws. 
22. 
No one can own the law. 
23. 
The authentic exposition of the law, binding on every citizen, is free for 
publication to all. 
24. 
A real and substantial controversy exists between the parties regarding the 
subject matter of this counterclaim because NFPA has brought a claim for copyright

infringement against UpCodes based, at least in part, on the accessibility of the Posted 
Laws on the UpCodes service. 
FIRST COUNTERCLAIM 
(Declaratory Judgment of No Copyright Infringement) 
25. 
UpCodes incorporates herein by reference the contents of each of the 
preceding paragraphs. 
26. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because it is in the public domain because it is the law. 
27. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because the text of every law constitutes a fact that cannot be 
accurately expressed any other way, and thus merges with any expression contained in 
that text. 
28. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because any claim of infringement is barred or limited by the 
idea/expression dichotomy. 
29. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because the Posted Laws constitutes “scenes a faire.” 
30. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because any claims of infringement are barred or limited by the 
government edicts doctrine.

31. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because the Posted Laws were authored in whole or in part by third 
parties. 
32. 
The inclusion of the Posted Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any 
copyright of NFPA because, to the extent there is copying of copyrightable expression, 
that copying is de minimis. 
33. 
The inclusion of the Posted laws on UpCodes does not infringe any copyright 
of NFPA because, to the extent there is copying of copyrightable expression, that copying 
constitutes fair use. 
34. 
UpCodes is entitled to a judicial declaration that the inclusion of the Posted 
Laws on UpCodes does not infringe any copyright of NFPA. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
Wherefore, UpCodes prays that a judgment be entered against NFPA as follows: 
a. 
That the Court declare that UpCodes is not liable for copyright 
infringement arising out of the inclusion of the Posted Laws on 
UpCodes. 
b. 
That the Court declare that NFPA lacks a valid copyright in any 
portion of the Posted Laws; 
c. 
That the Court award UpCodes costs of suit, including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees under the Copyright Act; and

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
Plaintiff National Fire Protection Association, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “NFPA”), 
through its undersigned counsel, brings this Complaint against UpCodes, Inc. 
(“UpCodes”) for infringing NFPA’s exclusive rights under the Copyright Act (17 
U.S.C. § 101 et seq.).  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1338(a), and 17 U.S.C. § 501(b).  NFPA alleges, on personal 
knowledge as to itself and information and belief as to others, as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
UpCodes, which has its Principal Executive Office in this District, is 
building a business from the mass commercial exploitation of NFPA’s copyrighted 
standards (“Works”).  UpCodes markets its online services to the architecture, 
engineering, and construction (“AEC”) industries.  It attracts AEC professionals 
with free access and the ability to print and download NFPA’s Works and the works 
of others.  UpCodes did not seek a license to use NFPA’s Works to build its 
business.  UpCodes just helped itself to NFPA’s Works without incurring or 
contributing to the substantial costs NFPA incurs in creating and revising those 
Works.  UpCodes’ infringing conduct threatens irreparable harm to NFPA and the 
public.   
2. 
NFPA is a self-funded, nonprofit (501(c)(3)), nongovernmental 
voluntary consensus standards body (“VCSB”) (a type of standards development 
organization (“SDO”)).  NFPA creates and disseminates voluntary consensus 
standards on a wide range of subjects, including building, design, equipment, and 
installation, that protect the public from the dangers and loss that may result from 
fire, faulty electrical wiring, and many other hazards.  NFPA’s ability to create and 
revise such standards, and to invest in the development and creation of new 
standards, is critically dependent upon its ability to be paid by the people who use 
those standards, namely, the tradespeople and businesses in the AEC and other 
industries who use the Works in the course of their profit-making businesses.

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
3. 
NFPA exercises its exclusive rights as a copyright owner by selling 
physical copies of its Works; licensing rights to third-parties who include those 
Works in their offerings and make authorized derivative works for distribution; and 
offering a recently launched subscription service that provides digital access to a 
library of standards with additional features that facilitate professionals’ use of 
NFPA’s Works.  NFPA also recognizes that members of the public who do not 
utilize its Works in their business may be interested in what they say.  For 15 years, 
NFPA has posted copies of its Works for free online viewing, meaning that any 
member of the public who wants to know what the Works say can easily access and 
review those Works.   
4. 
UpCodes makes money from distributing NFPA’s works to the same 
businesses and tradespeople who pay NFPA and its licensees for the use of NFPA’s 
Works.  But UpCodes competes with an unfair advantage:  UpCodes does not have 
a license and pays NFPA nothing for the rights it exploits. 
5. 
UpCodes employs a “freemium” business strategy that is popular 
among startups and through which UpCodes displays and distributes NFPA’s Works 
on its website to end users without charge.  UpCodes thereby facilitates its users’ 
downloading, printing, and further distributing NFPA’s Works.  The “free” tier 
directly advances UpCodes’ financial interest by increasing its base of users and 
therefore its marketshare and ability to attract investment.  UpCodes then “upsells” 
those users to a “premium” tier, where users pay UpCodes monthly subscription 
fees.  The premium tier includes all the same unauthorized exploitation of NFPA’s 
Works as on the free tier, along with additional features, including the creation and 
distribution of unauthorized and infringing derivative versions of NFPA’s Works. 
6. 
UpCodes’ strategy of building a business based on copyright 
infringement is working.  According to recent press accounts, UpCodes has close to 
a half-million monthly active users (and growing), and recently raised more than $3 
million in equity funding.

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
7. 
UpCodes apparently believes it can exploit NFPA’s Works without 
paying for them because a district court in another Judicial District recently denied 
summary judgment to a different organization, the International Code Council, Inc. 
(“ICC”), relating to different works and involving different precedent that is 
uniquely applicable to ICC’s “model codes.”  See ICC v. UpCodes, 2020 WL 
2750636 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  NFPA respectfully submits that decision was in error, 
but in all events, that court’s bases for its order are neither binding nor persuasive in 
this Court.  NFPA’s Works are protected by copyright regardless of whether or 
when a governmental entity may rely on those Works through a process known as 
incorporation by reference (“IBR”).  The decisions and actions of the Legislative, 
Executive, and Judicial Branches, as well as 125 years of history, confirm that 
NFPA’s Works retain their protection under copyright. 
8. 
The Legislative and Executive Branches have endorsed the public-
private IBR partnership and the continuation of copyright protection for 
organizations like NFPA.  The system strikes a careful balance among the interests 
of copyright owners, governments, and the public at large. 
9. 
Specifically, in 1995, Congress enacted the National Technology 
Transfer and Advancement Act (“NTTAA”).  Congress directed that “all Federal 
agencies and departments shall use technical standards that are developed or 
adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies ... as a means to carry out policy 
objectives or activities.”  NTTAA, Pub. L. No. 104-113 § 12(d) (emphasis added).  
As part of the NTTAA, Congress created and empowered the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (“NIST”) (under the Department of Commerce):  
to facilitate standards-related information sharing and cooperation 
between Federal agencies and to coordinate the use by Federal agencies 
of private sector standards, emphasizing where possible the use of 
standards developed by private, consensus organizations. 
15 U.S.C. § 272(b)(3).  NIST, in turn, has issued guidance through an IBR 
Handbook, which instructs federal agencies to “balance” considerations, including

COMPLAINT 
 
“work[ing] with copyright owners to further the goals of both transparency and 
public-private collaboration.”  See Office of the Fed. Register (“OFR”), IBR 
Handbook 8–9 (2018), https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-
register/write/handbook/ibr.pdf.  The OFR has also specifically stated that VCSB 
standards “should not lose their copyright” as a result of IBR and rejected proposals 
to the contrary.     
10. 
Likewise, the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) has 
recognized that the IBR system yields significant public benefits:  voluntary 
consensus standards are high quality, uniform, and developed through a rigorous 
process without the risks of industry capture.  OMB, Circular A-119 (2016), 
https://www.nist.gov/system/files/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_01-22-2016.pdf.  
And, the standards are developed without any cost to cash-strapped bodies at all 
levels of government.  Id. at 14, 18.  OMB has also recognized the importance of 
preserving copyright owners’ rights as part of this balance, and has directed that 
federal agencies “must observe and protect the rights of the copyright holder and 
any other similar obligations” when they IBR any part of a standard.  Id. at 22 
(emphasis added). 
11. 
The Judicial Branch has also confirmed that IBR does not by itself 
divest copyright, both as a matter of statutory interpretation and the policy interests 
at stake.  In particular, the Ninth Circuit, in Practice Management Information Corp. 
v. American Medical Ass’n (“AMA”), 121 F.3d 516 (9th Cir. 1997), amended, 133 
F.3d 1140 (1998), rejected the claim of a party in UpCodes’ position that a federal 
agency’s incorporation of a private party’s copyrighted coding system divested the 
underlying copyright.   
12. 
For over 125 years, NFPA has served the role of publishing and 
disseminating standards for the private sector.  The government has decided to build 
on that success—benefiting from the quality of those resource-intensive Works and

avoiding the costs of creating its own standards—and not to undermine the 
incentives and ability for VCSBs like NFPA to create and revise standards.   
13. 
UpCodes’ liability for copyright infringement is clear, as is the 
irreparable harm to NFPA, including harm to the development of a legitimate 
market for its standards, its licensing relationships, and its overall mission.  
Preservation of the status quo requires enjoining UpCodes from offering NFPA’s 
standards during the pendency of this litigation (and ultimately, permanently).  
NFPA brings this lawsuit for injunctive relief and damages to protect both its 
copyrights and the public interests at stake.   
THE PARTIES 
14. 
Plaintiff NFPA is a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation with its 
principal place of business located at One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, 
Massachusetts 02169.   
15. 
Defendant UpCodes is a Delaware corporation with its principal place 
of business in this District, at 340 South Lemon Avenue, #9050, Walnut, California 
91789.  UpCodes’ street address of its principal executive office, UpCodes’ mailing 
address, and the address for its CEO, Secretary, and CFO are at the same location in 
Walnut, California.  On February 15, 2021, UpCodes filed a Statement of 
Information with the California Secretary of State signed by “SR” (i.e., Scott 
Reynolds) certifying that this information is true and correct. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
16. 
This is an action for infringement and contributory infringement of 
federally registered copyrights in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501. 
17. 
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1338(a), and 17 U.S.C. § 501(b). 
18. 
Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and 
1400(a) because UpCodes resides in and/or may be found in this District, and 
because the claims alleged herein arose in substantial part in this District.

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
BACKGROUND FACTS 
NFPA And The Creation Of Its Copyrighted Works 
19. 
NFPA is a nonprofit organization, founded in 1896 and born of the 
need to have consistent installation standards for fire prevention across industries.  
Different standards created confusion and undermined the goal of fire safety.  
Government did not solve this problem; NFPA did.  Various organizations came 
together to found NFPA, and in just one year, NFPA published the first edition of 
the National Electrical Code. 
20. 
Today, NFPA publishes more than 300 standards, including NFPA 70, 
the National Electrical Code (“NEC”), the world’s leading standard for electrical 
safety, and NFPA 101, the Life Safety Code, a widely used standard for building 
construction, protection and occupancy features that minimize the effects of fire and 
related hazard on human life.   
21. 
NFPA’s standards are independent, state-of-the-art, and of the highest 
quality.  NFPA creates standards using the “voluntary consensus” process, which is 
coordinated and accredited by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), 
a nonprofit, nongovernmental membership organization.  NFPA is ANSI accredited, 
meaning that its standards development process meets ANSI’s requirements for 
openness, balance, consensus, due process, and the allowance of neutral oversight 
and public notice and comment.  The voluntary consensus process ensures that all 
interested parties have an opportunity to participate in a standard’s development.  
The result is a private-public partnership in the truest sense:  NFPA brings together 
industry, non-profits, consumer groups, academics, members of the public, and 
officials to facilitate a process that then benefits each stakeholder and the public. 
22. 
NFPA’s rigorous and open standards development process requires 
NFPA to expend substantial resources on standards development.  The process does 
not cost the public or participants a fee.  Rather, NFPA pays for salary and benefits 
for its administrative, editorial, and expert staff who facilitate the development; for

office space and meeting facilities for the more than 260 Technical Committees who 
participate in NFPA’s standards development processes; and for outreach and 
education efforts, information technology, and other costs of development. 
23. 
For example, NFPA invests significant resources in the development of 
each new edition of the NEC.  For the current edition (2020; work on the 2023 NEC 
is ongoing), the preparation of the first draft report involved consideration of over 
3,800 proposed language changes including those from the public.  A total of 515 
Technical Committee members on 18 Code-Making Panels and a Correlating 
Committee were supported by more than 35 NFPA staff members.  The Panels and 
Committee held concurrent, multi-day committee meetings for a total of seventy-
four meeting days.  The first draft was finalized by a four-day meeting of the 
Correlating Committee, assisted by three NFPA staff members.  The preparation of 
the second draft report involved consideration of over 1,900 public comments, and 
64 Committee meetings over a two-week period, assisted by at least 35 NFPA staff 
members.  There were two more multi-day Correlating Committee meetings prior to 
the issuance of the NEC.  In addition, there have been numerous conference calls, 
task group meetings, online seminars, and other interactions among Committee 
Members and NFPA staff.   
24. 
NFPA owns the copyrights in its published standards.  Attached as 
Exhibit A is a list of the twelve NFPA Works (along with dates and identifying 
numbers for their corresponding certificates of copyright registration) that UpCodes 
is currently exploiting without authorization.1 
                                           
1 To the extent UpCodes adds more of NFPA’s Works to its service, this Complaint 
shall incorporate any future added Works as if listed herein.  At present, UpCodes’ 
website indicates its intentions to add at least three more of NFPA’s standards, 
which are also listed on Exhibit A:  NFPA 1 (2021); NFPA 13 (2019); NFPA 101 
(2021).

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
25. 
The primary consumers of NFPA Works are professionals and 
tradespeople from the AEC industry—professionals such as electricians, architects, 
general contractors and subcontractors, and electrical equipment manufacturers—
who utilize these standards in the course of their business.  These professionals 
access NFPA’s Works through purchased physical copies, enterprise licenses, or 
NFPA’s more recently launched subscription services, such as NFPA LiNK.   
See https://www.nfpa.org/link. 
26. 
Since 2006, NFPA has also ensured that the public has access to any 
current and newly published standards, including those that are incorporated by 
reference, by making those standards available on NFPA’s website for free online 
reading.  NFPA encourages other organizations and even governments to link to 
these standards available on its website.   
27. 
NFPA funds its standards development activities, and much of its other 
mission-driven work, primarily with the revenue obtained from exercising its 
exclusive rights as the copyright owner of those Works.  NFPA sells physical copies 
to professionals in the AEC industries (the NEC is about $100 and other standards 
are less).  NFPA also licenses its Works to other publishers and organizations to 
make and sell copies or derivative works therefrom, such as checklists.

NFPA also offers access to its Works through digital subscription 
services, including NFPA LiNK (https://www.nfpa.org/link).  This subscription 
service permits users to have digital access to a library of NFPA Works, and utilize 
the Works in different ways, such as through advanced and dynamic search tools to 
help users locate provisions of relevance to those users across NFPA’s different 
Works; expert commentary and visual aids; tools that allow users to bookmark and 
annotate provisions of the Works; tools that allow users to group various provisions 
of the Works together in a saved collection for a project; and tools that allow users 
to collaborate and share information with colleagues.   
See https://www.nfpa.org/link.  NFPA views the success of this new subscription 
offering as crucial to its business and its public-safety mission in the digital era.

COMPLAINT 
 
29. 
NFPA does not authorize copying or distribution of the Works without 
a license.  The alternative—widespread and uncontrolled dissemination of those 
standards—risks destroying the public-private partnership that makes those 
standards possible in the first place. 
UpCodes And Its Infringing Activities 
30. 
UpCodes is a for-profit corporation. 
31. 
UpCodes’ target market is also the tradespeople and other professionals 
from the AEC industries who are NFPA’s customers.  Even on its “free” tier, 
UpCodes makes clear its intended audience is comprised of professionals who use 
standards in their business rather than people motivated by curiosity or political 
activism about what the standards say.  UpCodes’ home page states:  “UpCodes 
helps the AEC industry deliver code compliant buildings.  We provide tools to 
manage building codes, avoid project delays, and clarify requirements.”   
32. 
Under the heading “TRUSTED BY INDUSTRY LEADERS,” 
UpCodes’ website prominently features AEC companies that apparently use its 
services, including well-known construction companies, such as Clark Construction 
and Fluor, and well-known architectural firms, such as SOM and Stantec.   
33. 
UpCodes markets its service directly to these and other participants in 
the AEC industries.  UpCodes’ marketing emphasizes its goal of building and 
selling online tools that such professionals may use in the course of their business.  
For example, UpCodes highlights “workflows” for various professionals, including 
General Contractors.  UpCodes explains how it can help the construction industry 
through “[m]ore accurate pre-construction services,” which allow professionals to 
“[s]tay on time and on budget,” and “[w]ork from up-to date [sic] code.”

See https://up.codes/workflows/general_contractor.  UpCodes has similar marketing 
“workflows” for architects, subcontractors, code consultants, owners, and others.    
34. 
 To grow its business, UpCodes employs a “freemium” model, i.e., one 
that provides a free service to attract users and then promotes the paid “premium”

version of that service.  What UpCodes makes available for “free” and for a price is 
the unauthorized exploitation of NFPA’s Works.  Here’s how UpCodes operates:   
35. 
Anyone who visits UpCodes’ service is prompted to “FIND YOUR 
CODES” as the very first, and most prominent link: 
 
See https://up.codes/. 
36. 
Clicking on “FIND YOUR CODES” does not take the user to a 
particular jurisdiction.  It instead takes the user to a list of publishers whose 
copyrighted standards UpCodes makes available on its service.  Where, as with 
NFPA, the publisher has released multiple volumes of the same standard, UpCodes 
lists those different versions by publication year.  The current UpCodes list includes 
twelve NFPA standards and three more that UpCodes appears to be in process of 
uploading.

Once the user selects the title and publication year, UpCodes takes the 
user to a roster of jurisdictions that it says have incorporated the standard by 
reference.  The user does not have to select a jurisdiction in which they reside.  
Rather, the user can see which jurisdictions are purported to have incorporated the

standard with or without amendment.  And the user can then click through to the 
UpCodes-reproduced copies of NFPA’s Work. 
38. 
Take, for example, the 2020 NEC, NFPA’s most recent version of that 
Work.  Users can access and navigate through the entire text of the Introduction and 
Chapters 1 through 9, article-by-article.  UpCodes says that it only posts “the law,” 
but its offerings include substantially all of the Works, including text that has no 
binding force even in those jurisdictions that have incorporated the Works by 
reference.  For example, UpCodes copies and posts the section of the introduction to 
the NEC that explains what is not covered by the standard.  UpCodes also copies 
and posts both the explanations of and the text of permissive rules and explanatory 
material, such as informational notes.  See Introduction art. 90.5(C).  “Such notes 
are informational only and are not enforceable as requirements of this Code.”  Id.  
UpCodes posts them anyway.

protection#200 (red box added).

39. 
In addition to full access, UpCodes’ free offering permits a user to print 
(or download as a PDF) substantially all of the Works.  Accordingly, anyone—even 
anonymously—can then print and redistribute substantially all of the NEC with just 
a few simple clicks. 
 
40. 
Because UpCodes employs a “freemium” model, these offerings of free 
access to, and the ability to download, print, and re-distribute substantially all of the 
posted Works, are intended to attract users to UpCodes’ service.  Once those users 
are on the site, UpCodes attempts to convince them to pay for a subscription.  The 
premium service offers additional features, such as searching across standards, 
annotations, making “projects,” bookmarking, sharing across users, and other 
derivative works like diagrams.  Users of UpCodes’ “free” service encounter 
persistent reminders to start a 2-week free trial of the premium service and see 
frequent “pop-ups” of advertisements for the premium service.  Attempting to use 
any premium feature, such as bookmarking, prompts the user to subscribe:

UpCodes’ model appears to be working.  In March, UpCodes 
announced that it had raised $3.36 million, bringing its total raised thus far to $4.15 
million.  Those reports stated that UpCodes had grown to 500,000 monthly active 
users, a substantial increase from even the amount then stated on its website of 
400,000 such users.   
42. 
UpCodes has also been clear regarding what it plans to do with this 
additional fundraising—it is going to grow, including by adding more standards.  In 
a Twitter post, UpCodes stated:  “Excited to announce that we’ve raised more funds.  
We’ll be doubling or tripling our team this year which means more features and 
more codes,” punctuated with a rocket emoji.

UpCodes Threatens NFPA With Irreparable Harm  
43. 
For most of its existence, UpCodes did not post NFPA standards.  That 
changed within the last few months.  UpCodes now provides NFPA’s Works to the 
same AEC tradespeople and businesses that otherwise would pay NFPA (or its 
licensees) for copies of its standards or subscriptions to NFPA LiNK.  UpCodes is 
growing.  NFPA faces irreparable harm as a result.   
44. 
First, and most urgently, UpCodes is interfering with and threatening 
the development of the emerging market for NFPA’s own subscription service, 
NFPA LiNK.  UpCodes offers substantially similar features and the same NFPA 
standards as NFPA LiNK but competes on unfair terms because it has not had to 
incur the costs and risks associated with developing the standards that are the 
lifeblood of UpCodes’ free and premium tiers of service.  UpCodes offers NFPA’s 
content for free, and that free access subsidizes the cost of the premium tier.  If AEC

professionals are led to believe that UpCodes is a legitimate alternative to NFPA 
LiNK, NFPA will lose potential subscribers.   
45. 
Second, UpCodes’ unauthorized conduct threatens the value of NFPA’s 
licenses and its goodwill and relationship with licensees.  If NFPA’s licensees or 
their customers could obtain the same material from UpCodes in digital format, 
without cost, and without restrictions on further dissemination, they will not want to 
pay NFPA for the rights to offer its standards in connection with their products and 
services.  NFPA has already heard about UpCodes from licensees.  UpCodes thus 
interferes with and undermines NFPA’s goodwill with its licensees, who may 
question why they are negotiating contracts, paying license fees, and abiding by 
license terms when UpCodes is offering the same (or more) content without paying 
anything or agreeing to any such terms.  Licensees depend on NFPA, as the 
copyright owner, to enforce its rights and protect the legitimate market for the 
Works.    
46. 
Third, UpCodes fundamentally and unlawfully undermines the market 
for NFPA’s Works.  UpCodes markets its service as a market substitute, not just for 
NFPA’s subscription service but also for the sale of physical copies of NFPA’s 
standards, which remains a critical source of NFPA’s lawful revenue for the sale of 
copies of its Works.  A corresponding reduction in revenue threatens NFPA’s ability 
to maintain its existing voluntary consensus standards development and revision 
processes at their level of investment and quality.  If NFPA cannot do that important 
work, standards may not keep up with technological advancements to address fire, 
electrical and related hazards.  This failure would result in a lower level of overall 
public safety.   
UpCodes Harms The Public Interest  
47. 
NFPA is part of a much larger public-private partnership that UpCodes 
directly undermines.

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
48. 
In general, IBR happens when a legislature or agency refers to a 
privately authored standard in the section of a statute or regulation.  Governmental 
bodies may, if they choose to do so, IBR some or all of a published standard into 
their regulatory requirements.   
49. 
IBR yields significant public benefits.  As the OMB has explained, 
voluntary consensus standards are high quality, uniform, and developed through a 
rigorous process without the risks of industry capture.  Circular A-119 at p. 16.  
And, the standards are developed without any cost to cash-strapped bodies at all 
levels of government.  See id. at pp. 14, 18.   
50. 
The U.S. Congress has not only approved the IBR process but 
mandated it:  “all Federal agencies and departments shall use technical standards 
that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies, using such 
technical standards as a means to carry out policy objectives or activities.”  NTTAA, 
Pub. L. No. 104-113 § 12(d), 110 Stat. 775, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 272. 
51. 
NFPA does not stop officials from relying on its important Works.  But 
neither do these officials take credit for or claim to be the creators of NFPA’s 
Works.  Quite the opposite: Congress and the Executive Branch have repeatedly 
recognized and endorsed reliance on copyrighted standards, without usurping the 
rights of the copyright owners.   
52. 
As noted above, Congress created NIST to coordinate the government’s 
involvement in standards development and IBR and has directed federal agencies to 
work with VCSBs to make standards available while being mindful of the copyright 
interests at stake.  The OFR, in the context of rejecting a requirement that the 
government publish incorporated standards on their sites for printing, downloading 
and redistribution (all of which UpCodes does), rejected the same arguments 
UpCodes has advanced and explained that “when the Federal government references 
copyrighted works, those works should not lose their copyright.”  Incorporation by 
Reference, 79 Fed. Reg. 66,267, 66,268 (Nov. 7, 2014).

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
53. 
In sum, UpCodes’ infringement is clear, and the private and public 
interests in respecting NFPA’s copyrights are manifest.  An injunction is required to 
stop UpCodes from profiting at the expense of NFPA and public safety. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Direct Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1), (2), (3), (5)) 
54. 
NFPA incorporates herein by reference each and every averment 
contained in paragraphs 1 through 53 inclusive. 
55. 
NFPA owns registered copyrights for the Works. 
56. 
UpCodes does not have NFPA’s authorization to exercise any of its 
exclusive rights in the Works, including the rights to reproduce, distribute, publicly 
display, or make derivative works based upon NFPA’s Works.  UpCodes makes 
unauthorized exploitation, and therefore infringes NFPA’s exclusive rights, in four 
respects:   
a.  
Reproduction Right, § 106(1):  UpCodes digitally reproduces 
large portions of NFPA’s Works on the UpCodes services.   
b. 
Derivative Works Right, § 106(2):  UpCodes recasts NFPA’s 
Works into different formats, including through compilations of 
chapters, charts and other materials, and text with user annotations 
created on the UpCodes site. 
c. 
Distribution Right, § 106(3):  UpCodes distributes NFPA’s 
Works by uploading them to the site where UpCodes’ users download, 
print, and further distribute copies.   
d.  
Public Display Right, § 106(5):  UpCodes displays the Works 
online.   
57. 
The infringement of each of NFPA’s Works constitutes a separate act 
of copyright infringement. 
58. 
UpCodes’ acts of infringement are willful, in disregard of and with 
indifference to NFPA’s rights.

Case No. 2:21-cv-05262
COMPLAINT 
 
59. 
As a direct and proximate result of the infringements by UpCodes, 
NFPA is entitled to damages and UpCodes’ profits in amounts to be proven at trial. 
60. 
Alternatively, at its election, NFPA is entitled to statutory damages, up 
to the maximum amount of $150,000 per statutory award by virtue of UpCodes’ 
willful infringement, or for such other amounts as may be proper under 17 U.S.C. 
§ 504. 
61. 
NFPA further is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and full costs 
pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505. 
62. 
As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and conduct, 
NFPA has sustained and will continue to sustain substantial, immediate and 
irreparable injury, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  Unless enjoined 
and restrained by this Court, UpCodes will continue to infringe NFPA’s rights in its 
Works.  NFPA is entitled to injunctive relief under 17 U.S.C. § 502. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Indirect Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1), (2), (3), (5))  
63. 
NFPA incorporates herein by reference each and every averment 
contained in paragraphs 1 through 62 inclusive. 
64. 
UpCodes knowingly distributes and publicly displays unlawful copies 
of NFPA’s Works with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate and/or materially 
contribute to others’ making unauthorized copies, distributing, displaying and/or 
making derivative works of NFPA’s Works. 
65. 
UpCodes’ acts of infringement are willful, in disregard of and with 
indifference to NFPA’s rights.

As a direct and proximate result of the infringements by UpCodes, 
NFPA is entitled to damages and UpCodes’ profits in amounts to be proven at trial.

THIRD PARTY COMPLAINT 
 
1. 
Age Fotostock America, Inc. (“Age Fotostock”) is a Delaware corporation whose 
registered agent is Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, 
Wilmington, DE 19808 and with its principle place of business at 594 Broadway # 707, New 
York, NY 10012. Age Fotostock is a global stock photographic agency. 
2. 
Age Fotostock and Michael Hipple agreed by contract dated July 2000 that Hipple 
would submit photographic images to Age Fotostock and Age Fotostock would market and 
sell those images to its customers and pay a commission to Hipple on its sales. 
3. 
Hipple submitted several photographic images to Age Fotostock, including the image 
shown in plaintiff’s Exhibit 2 to his Corrected Complaint (“Image”). 
4. 
Subsequent to his submission to Age Fototock, Hipple learned of plaintiff Mackie’s 
claims against other photographers, and requested that Age Fotostock remove the Image from 
its collection and from its website. Age Fotostock responded that keeping the Image on its 
website violated no copyright ownership. Age Fotostock left the Image on its website. 
5. 
Age Fotostock held itself out as having special expertise and experience in the stock 
photography business. Hipple relied upon Age Fotostock’s experience and expertise in the 
stock photography business. 
6. 
Age Fotostock failed to act with reasonable skill and ordinary care when it overruled 
Hipple’s request to pull the image. 
7. 
Age Fotostock, by its acts and failures to act, is responsible for the acts alleged by 
Plaintiff Mackie.

Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, as they were brought in an 
improper venue. 
9. 
Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, as they are so vague, ambiguous, 
and/or overbroad that Defendants cannot reasonably prepare a response. 
10. 
Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, as Plaintiff failed to render proper 
service of process. 
11. 
Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, due to failure to mitigate damages.

that, when measured against any actual damage suffered by Plaintiff, would be excessive, 
obviously unreasonable, and wholly disproportionate in violation of the Due Process Clause.

 Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, as the Photos contain elements 
taken from the public domain upon which a copyright infringement cannot be maintained. 
23. 
Plaintiff’s claims are barred, in whole or in part, as Defendants’ conduct was 
innocent, non-infringing, and not a willful infringement of copyright.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 
 
 
 
Case No.: 1:23-cv-04181-AKH 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND 
 
The plaintiff August Image, LLC (“Plaintiff”), by its undersigned attorney, R. Terry 
Parker, Esq., for its First Amended Complaint against the corporate defendant RunwayRiot, 
LLC (“Company Defendant”) and John Does 1-5 (“Member and Officer Defendants” and 
together with Company Defendant, collectively, “Defendants”), alleges as follows: 
SUBSTANCE OF THE ACTION 
 
1. 
This is a case of willful copyright infringement in violation of 17 U.S.C. 
 
§§ 106(1), 501.  Plaintiff’s business is licensing photographic works of renowned portrait 
and fashion photographers who painstakingly create works of art with the goal of having 
Plaintiff license those works for the slick, glossy covers and pages of beautiful magazines 
like Vogue, Elle, Glamour, and others.  Unfortunately, too many companies like 
Company Defendant take Plaintiff’s works without seeking licenses to use them as 
illustrations for shoddy, unpolished articles on websites where the images serve as click-
bait to drive advertising revenue for low budget websites.  When Plaintiff caught 
Company Defendant in the act of using Plaintiff’s intellectual property and sought a

licensing fee, Company Defendant ignored Plaintiff and continued its infringing use in 
reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s copyrights because it would be too expensive for Plaintiff 
to pursue a remedy in this Court.  It is a business model built on infringement, like 
infringement is no big deal.  But it is big deal.  Little infringements like this are to 
Plaintiff’s business—and to its industry—death by a thousand cuts.  Fortunately, 
Congress understood the serious threat of a thousand little infringements and provided in 
the Copyright Act statutory damages as a means for combatting that threat, providing 
statutory damages to deter the type of infringement at issue here and to encourage victims 
like Plaintiff to litigate their infringement claims, even in the face of the prohibitive costs 
of pursuing such claims in this Court. 
PARTIES 
2. 
Plaintiff is a New York Corporation with a principal place of business at 
793 Broadway, New York, New York 10003. 
3. 
Upon information and belief, Company Defendant is a foreign corporation 
operating a principal place of business at 584 Broadway, Suite 510, New York City, New York, 
10012. 
4. 
Upon information and belief, Member and Officer Defendants own or operate 
Company Defendant and can be located at 584 Broadway, Suite 510, New York City, New 
York, 10012. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 
5. 
This is a civil action seeking damages and injunctive relief for copyright 
infringement under the copyright laws of the United States, and therefore this Court has 
jurisdiction under 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.; 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), and 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 2 of 14
3 
 
28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (jurisdiction over copyright actions). 
6. 
Personal jurisdiction over Defendants is proper.  Defendants are conducting 
business in this judicial district and committing torts in this state, including without limitation 
Defendants’ copyright infringement, which causes harm in this state and judicial district. 
7. 
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue properly lies in this Court because a 
substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this judicial district. 
FACTS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS FOR RELIEF 
 
A. 
Plaintiff’s Business 
 
8. 
Plaintiff is a boutique agency offering a uniquely creative caliber of photography 
from its full-service rights managed collection.  Plaintiff is the exclusive representative for an 
elite group of creative and innovative contemporary photographers specializing in celebrity and 
fashion photography and video, including the celebrated photographers Camilla Akrans, Art 
Streiber, Mark Seliger, Alexi Lubomirski, Joe Pugliese, Kenneth Willardt, and Camilla Akrans, 
whose works are at issue in this litigation.  On behalf of its award-winning photographers, 
Plaintiff licenses photographic works from its catalogue to various third parties for various 
purposes, including editorial, advertising, corporate, and non-profit purposes.  In short, Plaintiff 
takes care of the business of monetizing the works of its photographers so that the photographers 
can take care of the business of creating award winning works. 
9. 
Plaintiff is, as the exclusive licensee, the beneficial owner of the copyrights in and 
to the photographic works at issue in this litigation, copies of which are attached hereto as 
Exhibit A (the “Copyrighted Works”). 
10. 
The Copyrighted Works are original works of authorship. 
11. 
Plaintiff is the exclusive licensee of the copyrights in and to the Copyrighted 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 3 of 14
4 
 
Works. 
12. 
Plaintiff licenses the Copyrighted Works for professional applications including 
editorial, advertising, corporate and non-profit use. 
13. 
Plaintiff is the exclusive licensee of the Copyrighted Works. 
14. 
Plaintiff has obtained registrations with the United States Copyrighted Office for 
the Copyrighted Works.  Attached hereto as Exhibit B are copies of the certificates for 
registration obtained from the United States Copyright Office. 
B. 
Company Defendant’s Unlawful Activities 
 
15. 
In or about August of 2022, Plaintiff discovered Company Defendant infringing 
Plaintiff’s exclusive copyrights in the Copyrighted Works.  Specifically, Plaintiff discovered the 
Copyrighted Works being reproduced, distributed, used in the creation of derivative works, and 
publicly displayed, without Plaintiff’s authorization at Company Defendant’s website, 
screenshots of which are attached hereto as Exhibit C.  
16. 
Upon information and belief, Company Defendant had access to the Copyrighted 
Works prior to the creation of its infringing website.  Company Defendant located the 
Copyrighted Works on the Internet and, without authorization from Plaintiff, downloaded the 
Copyrighted Works to computer systems owned or operated by Company Defendant, and then 
used the Copyrighted Works in the creation of webpages to attract users to visit and remain at 
Company Defendant’s website for commercial purposes of generating revenue, thus unlawfully 
committing a number of infringing acts, namely, reproducing, distributing, creating unlawful 
derivative works, and publicly displaying the Copyrighted Works. 
17. 
Company Defendant’s infringement did not begin and end with the first 
publication of the Copyrighted Works of Plaintiff on Company Defendant’s website because 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 4 of 14
5 
 
Company Defendant stored the Copyrighted Works on computer servers and computer systems 
and machines owned by Company Defendant where, in the last three years, the Copyrighted 
Works were reproduced, distributed, and publicly displayed by Company Defendant each time 
computer users in New York, and elsewhere, viewed Company Defendant’s infringing 
webpages.  In order for computer users to view the Copyrighted Works on monitors and display 
screens located in New York, Company Defendant had to reproduce digital copies of the 
Copyrighted Works from its servers and then distribute the digital copies through the Internet to 
the computer monitors and display screens throughout New York where the Copyrighted Works 
were then publicly displayed without Plaintiff’s authorization. 
18. 
Company Defendant is thus directly responsible for the unlawful reproduction, 
distribution, derivation, and public display of the Copyrighted Works within the last three years.  
19. 
Company Defendant’s reproduction, distribution, derivation, and public display of 
the Copyrighted Works are without Plaintiff’s authorization. 
20. 
Company Defendant’s unauthorized reproduction, distribution, derivation, and 
public display of Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Works are knowing and willful and in reckless 
disregard of Plaintiff’s copyrights in that Company Defendant, a sophisticated media company 
familiar with copyright law knows of the need to seek and obtain a license for the use of the 
Copyrighted Works before using them, knew it did not have permission to use Plaintiff’s 
Copyrighted Works, and deliberately did so anyway. 
21. 
Company Defendant’s willful violation of the Copyright Act is further evidenced 
in the vast number of infringements in this case. 
22. 
Hoping to avoid the cost of litigation, Plaintiff caused a number of infringement 
notices to be sent Company Defendant whereby Plaintiff sought licensing fees for Company 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 5 of 14
6 
 
Defendant’s use of Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Works, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 
D.  Because Company Defendant is one media company in a group of commonly owned and 
operated media companies Plaintiff also sent notices to the related company, Mediaite LLC.    
23. 
 In reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s copyright, Company Defendant failed to 
respond to Plaintiff's requests for licensing fees and continued its infringing use. 
24. 
Plaintiff was thus forced to seek remedy from this Court. 
C. 
Discovery of Company Defendant’s Unlawful Activity 
 
25. 
Plaintiff discovered these infringements after diligently searching the Internet for 
uses of Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Works.  Plaintiff’s diligent efforts to discover these infringements 
include Plaintiff engaging various third-party technology companies over the years to search the 
Internet for unlawful use of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works.  Plaintiff engages different image 
search services concurrently to routinely search the Internet for uses of Plaintiff’s copyrighted 
works because none of these companies are able to locate every use of Plaintiff’s copyrighted 
works on the Internet and each has offered different findings over the years.  Plaintiff believes 
these companies are not able to find every use of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works on the Internet 
because the current search technologies are not able to cover an enormous expanse of data points 
on the Internet.  It has been reported that there are 3.2 billion to 5 billion photos uploaded to the 
Internet every day, which on the low end comes to 1.68 trillion per year.  Upon information and belief, 
there are more photos uploaded to the Internet every day than a search company can process in a year.  
Accordingly, not every search by Plaintiff discloses every unlawful use of Plaintiff’s copyrighted 
works.  Plaintiff is thus not surprised that the diligently conducted searches more than three years 
prior to discovery of these infringements did not disclose Company Defendant’s use of the 
Copyrighted Works but searches conducted more recently did disclose Company Defendant’s 
infringements. 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 6 of 14
7 
 
26. 
The failure to discover these infringements sooner occurred not due to a lack of 
reasonable effort by Plaintiff but due to the vast amount of data on the Internet to be search and 
the inability of the technology currently available on the market to locate in a few searches every 
infringing use of photographs in Plaintiff’s catalogue.  Plaintiff understands and believes that it    
is not, and should not, be considered at fault for not discovering these infringements sooner than 
it did. 
D. 
The Scope of Company Defendant’s Infringement 
27. 
The purpose of Company Defendant reproducing, distributing, publicly displaying, 
and creating unauthorized derivative works from the Copyrighted Works was commercial.   
28. 
Company Defendant used the Copyrighted Works for the purpose of drawing 
users to Company Defendant’s website and thereby increase advertising revenues and the value 
of the website.   
29. 
The Copyrighted Works were not used for the purposes of “news reporting.”    
30. 
The infringing use by Company Defendant does not constitute a bona fide 
contribution to new knowledge or creative expression but merely repackages and pirates 
Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Works. 
31. 
The purpose for reproducing, distributing, publicly displaying the Copyrighted 
Works, and creating an unauthorized derivative works from the Copyrighted Works, is not 
educational.   
32. 
The reproduction, distribution, public display, and derivation of the Copyrighted 
Works are not for purposes of criticism.   
33. 
The reproduction, distribution, public display, and derivation of the Copyrighted 
Works does not transform the Copyrighted Works by adding new expression or meaning.  The 
Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 7 of 14
8 
 
purpose, character, and nature of the use do not deviate from Plaintiff’s: to provide artful, 
impactful, stimulating, and emotive visual imagery. 
34. 
The infringing use by Company Defendant of the Copyrighted Works does not 
add to the Copyrighted Works by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and 
understandings of the Copyrighted Works. 
35. 
The nature of the Copyrighted Works is artistic and of enormous cultural and 
historic value.   
36. 
The Company Defendant did not use a small portion of the Copyrighted Works 
but the entirety of the Copyrighted Works. 
37. 
The Company Defendant is a sophisticated media company that understands 
copyright law and the need to obtain a license to publish the copyrighted works of others.   
38. 
The infringing use by Company Defendant of the Copyrighted Works has harmed, 
and continues to harm, the potential market for or value of the Copyrighted Works by robbing 
Plaintiff of its exclusive right to license the Copyrighted Works and also by cheapening the value 
of works through association with Defendant Company and its reputation, or lack of reputation in 
the media industry.

DIRECT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
(17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) 
 
39. 
Plaintiff realleges the above paragraphs and incorporates them by reference as if

copyrights in the Copyrighted Works to bring suit. 
42. 
Upon information and belief, as a result of Plaintiff’s reproduction, distribution 
and public display of the Copyrighted Works, Company Defendant had access to the 
Copyrighted Works prior to the creation of Company Defendant’s infringing website.

By its actions, as alleged above, Company Defendant has infringed and violated 
Plaintiff’s exclusive rights in violation of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §501, by reproducing, 
distributing, using in the creation of an unlawful derivative work, and publicly displaying the 
Copyrighted Works at the infringing website. 
44. 
Upon information and belief, Company Defendant’s infringement of Plaintiff’s 
copyrights is willful and deliberate and Company Defendant has profited at the expense of

Plaintiff’s exclusive rights in the Copyrighted Works, Plaintiff is entitled to recover its actual 
damages resulting from Company Defendant’s uses of the Copyrighted Works without paying

be entitled to recover damages based on a disgorgement of Company Defendant’s profits from 
infringement of the Copyrighted Works, which amounts will be proven at trial. 
47. 
Company Defendant’s conduct has caused and any continued infringing conduct 
will continue to cause irreparable injury to Plaintiff unless enjoined by this Court.  Plaintiff has

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
(Contributory Copyright Infringement) 
 
48. 
Plaintiff realleges the above paragraphs and incorporates them by reference as if 
fully set forth herein. 
49. 
The Member and Officer Defendants had either actual or constructive knowledge 
of the above-described infringements and either induced, caused or materially contributed to the 
infringing conduct described above. 
50. 
By their actions, the Member and Officer Defendants’ acts of contributory 
infringement violate Plaintiff’s exclusive rights in violation of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 
§501. 
51. 
Upon information and belief, the foregoing acts of contributory infringement of 
Plaintiff’s copyright are willful and deliberate and The Member and Officer Defendants profited 
at the expense of Plaintiff. 
52. 
As a direct and proximate result of the Member and Officer Defendants 
contributory infringement of Plaintiff’s exclusive copyrights in the Copyrighted Works, Plaintiff 
is entitled to recover actual damages resulting from the Member and Officer Defendants’ uses of 
the Copyrighted Works without paying license fees, in an amount to be proven at trial.   
53. 
In addition, at Plaintiff’s election, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(b), Plaintiff shall 
be entitled to recover damages based on a disgorgement of the Member and Officer Defendants 
profits from infringement of the Copyrighted Works, which amounts will be proven at trial.

 In the alternative, and at Plaintiff’s election, Plaintiff is entitled to a maximum 
statutory damages, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c), in the amount of $150,000 with respect to the

Case 1:23-cv-04181-AKH   Document 24   Filed 08/03/23   Page 10 of 14
11

55. 
Plaintiff is entitled to his costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to 
17 U.S.C. § 505. 
56. 
The Member and Officer Defendants’ contributory infringement has caused and 
any continued infringing conduct will continue to cause irreparable injury to Plaintiff unless

Plaintiff is entitled to a permanent injunction prohibiting infringement of Plaintiff’s exclusive 
rights under copyright law. 
THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
(Vicarious Copyright Infringement) 
 
57. 
Plaintiff realleges the above paragraphs and incorporates them by reference as if 
fully set forth herein. 
58. 
To the extent any of the Member and Officer Defendants contend they did not 
directly infringe or contributorily infringe Plaintiff’s copyrights, Member and Officer Defendants 
each had the right or ability to control the direct infringement described above. 
59. 
As a result of each Member and Officer Defendants’ right or ability to supervise 
the direct infringement described above, the Member and Officer Defendants could have 
prevented or stopped the direct infringement but did not take any action to do so. 
60. 
The Member and Officer Defendants each had a direct financial interest in the 
reproduction, distribution and public display of the Copyrighted Works and each of the Member 
and Officer Defendants benefitted from that direct infringement.

infringement of Plaintiff’s copyrights and exclusive rights in the Copyrighted Works, Plaintiff is 
entitled to recover their actual damages resulting from the Member and Officer Defendants’ uses

statutory damages, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c), in the amount of $150,000 with respect to the 
vicarious infringement of the Copyrighted Works by the Member and Officer Defendants, or 
such other amounts as may be proper under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). 
64. 
Plaintiff is entitled to his costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to 
17 U.S.C. § 505. 
65. 
Defendants’ vicarious infringement has caused and any continued infringing 
conduct will continue to cause irreparable injury to Plaintiff unless enjoined by this Court.

permanent injunction prohibiting infringement of Plaintiff’s exclusive rights under copyright 
law.

state facts sufficient to constitute any claim upon which relief may be granted.

The FAC, and each and every purported claim for relief thereof, is 
barred (in whole or in part) because Defendant has not infringed and is not liable

Plaintiff’s purported copyrighted work. 
THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

The FAC, and each and every purported claim for relief thereof, is 
barred (in whole in part) because Defendant has not infringed and is not liable for 
the infringement of the purported copyrights that Plaintiff asserts in this action,

constituent original and protectable elements of Plaintiff’s purported copyrighted 
works, with a reasonable opportunity for investigation or discovery being likely to 
provide evidentiary support. 
FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
4.

SEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
7. 
Plaintiff’s claims and the relief requested are barred based on fair use. 
EIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

NINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
9. 
Defendant is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the 
FAC, and each and every purported claim for relief thereof, is barred (in whole or 
in part) because of Plaintiff’s unclean hands for which a reasonable opportunity for

TENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
10. 
Defendant is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the 
FAC, and each and every purported claim for relief thereof, is barred (in whole or 
in part) because Defendant was privileged and justified in acting as it did as a 
company acting for business purposes in the marketplace, protected by the privilege 
for competitors with a reasonable opportunity for investigation or discovery being 
likely to, provide evidentiary support. 
ELEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with a reasonable opportunity for 
investigation or discovery being likely to provide evidentiary support. 
TWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
12. 
The FAC, and each and every purported claim for relief thereof, is 
barred (in whole or in part) by the applicable statute of limitations, and among other 
things, Plaintiff is barred from seeking recovery for any of Defendant’s alleged

FOURTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
14. 
If Plaintiff suffered any damages, which Defendant denies, Defendant 
acted in good faith, innocent of any knowledge or intent to infringe Plaintiff’s rights

preclude liability, any general or statutory damages awarded to Plaintiff should be 
reduced accordingly. 
FIFTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

to state facts sufficient to permit recovery of statutory damages against Defendant;

EIGHTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
18. 
Defendant, upon information and belief, alleges that Plaintiff failed to 
mark properly its alleged copyrighted design and failed to give Defendant notice of 
the alleged copyright infringement. 
NINETEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
19. 
Defendant alleges that any purported damages sought by the Plaintiff 
in the form of Defendant’s profits are limited by the apportionment theory based on 
the percentage of profits attributable to the alleged infringement of the allegedly 
copyrighted work. 
TWENTIETH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
20. 
Defendant alleges that it is legally impossible for it to have engaged in 
infringement of Plaintiff’s purported copyrighted works, as Defendant did not 
supply, produce, license, manufacture, distribute, or sell Plaintiff’s purported 
copyrighted work. 
TWENTY-FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
21. 
Plaintiff’s claims and the relief requested are barred as Plaintiff’s 
alleged works are not copyrightable. 
TWENTY-THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
22. 
Plaintiff’s purported copyrighted works and Defendant’s works are not 
substantially similar, and thus Plaintiff cannot prove its claim of copyright 
infringement. 
TWENTY-FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
23. 
Plaintiff’s purported copyrighted works and Defendant’s works are not 
strikingly similar, and thus Plaintiff is obligated to prove access by Defendant to 
Plaintiff’s work in order to succeed on its claim of copyright infringement.

works.

For a determination that Plaintiff’s works are not copyrightable and an 
order that any related Certificates of Registration be cancelled; and

For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

CA 90058.  
FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS
BackGrid and the Relevant Copyrighted Photographs

after celebrity news.  It owns the intellectual property rights, including the copyrights, to 
celebrity photographs that have been licensed to numerous top-tier outlets, such as TMZ,

11.
A copy of BackGrid’s Copyright Registration Number VA0002062268, for 
a collection of photographs of Kourtney Kardashian, is attached as Exhibit E. 
12.
A copy of the deposit copy submitted in connection with the application for

Defendant and Its Willful Infringing Activity
15.
BackGrid alleges on information and belief that Fashion Nova is an online 
and “brick and mortar” apparel retailer. On its website, Fashion Nova boasts that “Nova 
Style” means “breaking the rules” – and apparently those “rules” include those 
prohibiting infringement of others’ intellectual property rights.  
16.
Through its various media outlets, Fashion Nova posted online copies of 
each of the copyrighted photos reflected in Exhibits A through H. Copies of the 
infringing posts are attached as Exhibits I through L. 
17.
Fashion Nova did not seek or obtain a license with respect to any of the 
copyrighted works it appropriated for itself. 
18.
BackGrid first put Fashion Nova on notice of its infringing activity in 
October 2017 with respect to the copyright registration attached as Exhibit A. Not only 
did Fashion Nova fail to resolve the infringement, since that time it infringed the 
registrations attached as Exhibits C, E, and G. Each of the four infringements of which 
BackGrid is aware were willful, and BackGrid expects to find evidence of additional 
infringements as discovery proceeds in this matter.

47. 
Rittersbacher is the owner of the real property located at 8300 West Sunset 
15 Boulevard, West Hollywood, California 90069 (""Subject Property""). The Subject 
16 Property is located in the heart of the Sunset Strip and was the site of the Standard 
17 Hollywood Hotel until its closure in January 2021. 
18 
48. 
Rittersbacher previously leased the Subject Property to Golden Crest, Inc. 
19 (""GCI"") pursuant to a written ground lease, dated July 9, 1959 (""Ground Lease""), who 
20 in-tum subleased the commercial structure thereon to Ferrado Hollywood, LLC 
21 (""Ferrado""). Ferrado operated the Hotel at all relevant times through its affiliate, 
22 HotelCrafters Hollywood, LLC. 
23 
49. 
The Ground Lease provided that any sublease of the Subject Property 
24 required Rittersbacher' s consent. Despite this, GCI purportedly subleased a small pad 
25 on the northwest comer of the Subject Property to Melven Genser Outdoor Advertising, 
26 Inc. (""Genser"") pursuant to that certain Billboard Lease (without Rittersbacher's 
27 knowledge), where Genser operated an existing billboard structure until it sold its rights 
28 in the Billboard Lease to Outdoor Specialists, LLC. Outdoor was later dissolved and

The Billboard Lease according to its terms was to expire in 2021. 
51. 
On September 12, 2019, GCI and Osik entered into that certain Amendment 
to Billboard Lease (""Amendment"") purporting to extend the term of to 2027, again 
without the approval or consent of Defendant. However, the Amendment provided that: 
Lessee [Osik] acknowledges that Lessor's [GCI's] rights in the 
Property are derived through a ground lease under which Lessor 
is the ground lessee. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that if 
for any reason the ground lease is terminated, neither Lessor 
nor any of Lessor's officers, directors, shareholders, employees, 
agents, contractors or representative shall have any liability to 
Lessee and all rights of Lessee under the Lease shall 
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect 
contemporaneous with termination of said ground lease. 
52. 
The Amendment is unequivocal that GCI does not own the Subject 
17 Property. Osik's principal understood that paragraph to mean that the Billboard Lease 
18 would end at the same time as the Ground Lease. 
19 
53. 
In or around April 2019, the City of West Hollywood began a program to 
20 facilitate the installation of digital signage on the Sunset Strip. As a prerequisite to 
21 issuance of the permits that would be necessary to build and operate a digital sign, the 
22 City required application for permission to do so. Such approval was referred to in the 
23 program as a ""Concept Award."" If an application received a Concept Award it would be 
24 permitted to file an application for a permit to install and maintain a digital display sign 
25 
upon their property located on the Sunset Strip.

Osik and its now admitted partner, New Tradition Media, submitted an 
application for a Concept Award, on or about November 4, 2019. Included in the

1 sign concept which Plaintiff now claims are subject to a copyright owned by Plaintiff, 
2 Osik and their architect. In the materials submitted to the City of West Hollywood no 
3 reference to any copyright protection was included or asserted. The application was 
4 submitted without Rittersbacher' s knowledge or consent. And, in doing so, the 
5 application falsely stated in the owner of the Subject Property was: ""The Standard Hotel: 
6 8300 West Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood [sic] California [sic] 90069."" And that it 
7 had the owner's permission to file the application. This false statement was made under

10 
penalty of perjury. 
55. 
Awards and permits for use of real property in the City of West Hollywood 
issued under the City's program are not issued to sign operators. Instead, they constitute 
11 
entitlements running with the land, and are issued to the real property where the use will 
12 
be exercised and its owners. In line with this, when a prospective operator does not own 
13 
14 the property upon which they intend to install a digital sign, the City of West Hollywood 
15 requires that the application be signed by the property owner and an affirmation that 
16 consent and approval has been given to the applicant to submit the application. 
17 
56. 
When the City of West Hollywood learned of the misrepresentation, they 
18 ceased dealing with Osik and New Tradition Media and contacted Defendant 
19 Rittersbacher and informed it that it and not Osik or New Tradition was recognized by 
20 the City of West Hollywood as holder of all rights pertaining to the installation of a 
21 digital display sign at the Subject Property. 
22 
57. 
On September 3, 2021, GCI and Ferrado surrendered the Subject Property 
23 and terminated the Master Lease. Immediately thereafter, Defendant undertook efforts 
24 to sell the Subject Property. 
Despite the language of the Amendment and despite 
25 assurances that it would surrender the premises, Osik refused to do so. Defendant 
26 Rittersbacher is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that Plaintiff New 
27 Tradition orchestrated Osik's change in position. Instead of vacating the Subject 
28 Property they sought to extract financial and legal concessions to which they were not

In April 2022, Defendant Rittersbacher entered into a purchase and sale 
agreement for the sale of the Subject Property. After that time Plaintiff New Tradition 
and Osik continued their efforts to extract a financial settlement, as well as an agreement 
to enter into a new lease for a billboard at the Subject Property. As part of their coercive 
efforts, New Tradition and Osik claimed that they have and had the right to a portion of 
the sales price for the Subject Property that they attribute to the Concept Award. They 
maintain their claims despite the fact that the Concept A ward does not represent the right 
12 
to actually build or install anything. No approval has been given by the City to permit 
13 
a digital display sign and no building permits have been issued. New Tradition and Osik 
14 
15 have attempted to use these claims to interfere with the pending sale of the Subject 
16 Property to third parties and have in fact interfered with the closing of the purchase and 
17 sale transaction. 
18 
59. 
As a result of their interference, New Tradition and Osik have delayed the 
19 closing of the transaction and caused financial harm to Defendant Rittersbacher. 
20 Defendant Rittersbacher filed suit on June 3, 2022, in the Los Angeles Superior Court in 
21 the action entitled Rittersbacher Sunset LLC vs. Osik Media, LLC, bearing Case Number 
22 22SMCV (""State Action""). In response, Plaintiffs partner, Osik, filed a cross-complaint 
23 asserting that it was entitled to compensation for the ""regulatory jackpot"" it hit with the 
24 Concept A ward and specifically referenced the Copyright Materials in its cross-
25 complaint and demanded compensation of $20,000,000, thus continuing in the scheme 
26 of New Tradition and Osik to obtain monies from Defendant Rittersbacher that they were 
27 not entitled to. A true and correct copy of the Cross-complaint is attached hereto as 
28 Exhibit A. During the pendency of that action, on October 19, 2022, Defendant's

60. 
On November 16, 2022, counsel for Plaintiff submitted a letter advising 
4 counsel for Defendant Rittersbacher that a copyright registration had been issued by the 
5 United States Copyright Office. A true and correct copy of said letter is attached hereto 
6 as Exhibit B, and incorporated herein by reference as though set forth in full. The letter 
7 
8 
9 
10 
does not identify when the application was submitted to the Copyright Office and it does 
not identify when the copyright registration was issued. A review of the registration 
revealed that the application was first submitted to the Copyright Office on July 11, 
2022, (which was one month after Defendant Rittersbacher filed an action for unlawful 
11 
detainer to remove Osik from the Subject Premises) and that the registration was issued 
12 
on November 2, 2022, just two weeks before sending the November 16, 2022, letter. 
13 
14 
61. 
The registration was solely for a 2-D representation of a billboard that was 
15 submitted to the City of West Hollywood as part of Plaintiff's and Osik's application for 
16 a Concept Award. It did not purport to include any rights to construct or restrict the 
17 construction of any billboard at the Subject Property. 
18 
62. 
In response to Exhibit B, counsel Plaintiff submitted a letter on November 
19 28, 2022, setting forth that Defendant Rittersbacher never intended to make use of the 
20 Copyright Material, regardless of any copyrights asserted by Plaintiff and that there was 
21 no intent to do so in the future. A true and correct copy of said letter is attached hereto 
22 as Exhibit C. That letter unequivocally states that Defendant Rittersbacher never stated 
23 or represented that it could or would transfer any of the Copyright Material to any person 
24 and that it did not intend to do so in the future. Counsel for Defendant Rittersbacher 
25 went on to advise Plaintiff's counsel that the depictions in the Copyright Materials could 
26 not be used and were useless. In particular, the contents of the Copyright Material 
27 depicted a billboard that transgressed onto real property that was owned by the County 
28 of Los Angeles and not within the jurisdiction of the City of West Hollywood.

As a result of the pendency of the State Action, an adjudication in this

from rendering a declaratory action and refrain from issuing any injunctive orders in this 
action. 
FIFTH DEFENSE 
(Lack of Need for Declaratory Relief) 
69. 
Plaintiffs' claims are barred in whole or in part because Plaintiffs have 
13 failed to mitigate the, if any. Plaintiffs are, for example, well aware of the ability to 
14 request the removal from Y ouTube of allegedly infringing content using the process set 
15 forth in the DMCA. To the extent Plaintiffs failed to employ that process with respect to

SIXTH DEFENSE 
(Failure to Attach Copyright Material) 
70. 
Plaintiff has failed to attach to the complaint a full and complete copy of 
21 the asserted Copyright Registration, including its deposit material submission to the 
22 United States Copyright office and therefore this Court is precluded from entering

Any alleged use of any copyright material, if there was any, does not

FOURTEENTH DEFENSE 
(Laches) 
78. 
Plaintiffs claims are barred in whole or in party by the doctrine of Laches 
in that they unreasonably delayed in claiming any copyrights to the alleged Copyright 
Material. 
FIFTEENTH DEFENSE 
(Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel) 
14 
79. 
Central to its claims in this action is that they are entitled to benefits derived 
15 from the City of West Hollywood's granting of permission for the owner of the Subject 
16 Property to apply for a permit to install and maintain a digital display sign at that 
17 Property. As the City of West Hollywood has recognized in its official records that 
18 Defendant Rittersbacher is the sole party with lawful rights to pursue and obtain such 
19 permission, this Court is precluded from adjudicating those rights. In addition, Plaintiff 
20 has failed to challenge, appeal or seek reconsideration of the actions of the City of West 
21 Hollywood. [the unlawful detainer action - they claimed rights re copyright material -
22 res judicata - plaintiff was aware and participated. And, to the extent that issues in the 
23 Unlawful Detainer were substantially similar to those in this action, Plaintiff is barred 
24 from litigating them in this court.

SIXTEENTH DEFENSE

27 
(Lack of Jurisdiction for Declaratory Judgement) 
80. 
Plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action does state an Article III Case and 
28 Controversy and, as such, are barred in whole or in part.

EIGHTEENTH DEFENSE 
(No Copyright Infringement) 
82. 
Plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action does state an actual act or omission 
that constitutes copyright infringement. 
NINETEENTH DEFENSE 
(Functional and Generic Design) 
83. 
The alleged Copyright Material contains functional and generic depictions 
and are not enforceable in this action. 
TWENTIETH DEFENSE 
(Lack of Standing/Misjoinder) 
84. 
The Complaint admits that others claim to own a portion of the rights to the 
17 alleged Copyright Material. As a result of their failure to name these other parties as 
18 plaintiffs or defendants, there is a misjoinder that precludes granting of relief in this 
19 action.

TWENTY-SECOND DEFENSE 
(De Minimis V se) 
86. 
The allegations set forth in the Complaint fails to establish infringing 
28 activity and, at most, reflect a de minimis use of the alleged Copyright Material.

#:89
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Osik Media, LLC (""Osik"") cross-complains against 
2 Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Rittersbacher Sunset, LLC (""RSL"") as follows: 
3 
4 
1. 
NATURE OF THIS CROSS-COMPLAINT 
RSL owns the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, where Osik 
5 operates a billboard under a sublease (the Billboard Lease). RSL leased the property to an entity 
6 called Golden Crest, Inc. (GCI), which was Osik's sublessor. In early 2019, the City established an 
7 Arts and Advertising Program for the placement of electronic billboards on the Sunset Strip, where 
8 the property is located. Osik and a partner entity applied for design approval for a 989-square foot 
9 digital billboard and a new static sign on the property. RSL paid no attention to Osik's activities, and 
IO Osik was unaware of RSL's existence until its application was nearly completed. On March 23, 
11 2021, the City granted Osik's application and issued a design excellence award for property. The 
12 award doubled the value of the property from an appraised $60-70 million in 2020 to an agreed sale 
13 price of $120 million in late 2021. 
14 
2. 
RSL then sought to kick Osik off the property and take all the benefit of Osik's 
15 design approval. Litigation erupted in 2020 between RSL and GCI over the rent GCI was to pay. In 
16 September 2021, RSL and GCI entered into a contractual termination of GCI's lease. RSL then 
17 demanded that Osik vacate the premises. RSL argued that under a 2019 Amendment, the Billboard 
18 Lease terminated along with the GCI lease. Osik disputes RSL 's termination arguments, and RSL 
19 has sought to pressure Osik to leave by filing this lawsuit for what is now about $9 million in 
20 damages. 
21 
3. 
By this Cross-Complaint Osik seeks three types of relief: ( 1) a declaratory judgment 
22 that the Billboard Lease remains in full effect through the end of its term in 2027; alternatively, if it 
23 must give up possession of its billboard, Osik seeks (2) part of the $50-60 million Osik added to the 
24 property; and (3) damages for RSL's interference with the Billboard Lease. 
25 
26 
4. 
THE PARTIES 
At all relevant times, RSL was and is a limited liability company organized and 
27 existing under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Springfield, 
28 Oregon. At all relevant times, RSL was the owner of the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West

Hollywood. The property is the site of the Hollywood Standard Hotel ( closed in January 2021) and a 
2 billboard Osik operates under the Billboard Lease.

5. 
At all relevant times, Osik was and is a limited liability company organized and 
4 existing under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Altadena, 
5 California, in Los Angeles County. 
6 
6. 
Osik does not know the true names of defendants DOES 1 through 10, and therefore 
7 sues them by those fictitious names. Osik is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 
8 each of those defendants was in some manner legally responsible for the events and happenings 
9 alleged in this complaint and for Osik's injury as alleged herein. The names, capacities, and 
10 relationships of DOES 1 through 10 will be alleged by amendment to this complaint when they are 
11 known. 
12 
7. 
Osik is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all times mentioned in 
13 this complaint, defendants were the agents and employees of their codefendants, and in doing the 
14 things alleged in this complaint were acting within the course and scope of that agency and 
I 5 employment. 
16

8. 
FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION 
In 1959, the predecessors-in-interest of RSL and GCI entered into a 99-year master 
18 Ground Lease. At all times relevant to this Cross-Complaint, GCI was the master lessor. Paragraph 
19 3 of the Ground Lease called for a rent adjustment every 20 years. The rent was to be 8% of the 
20 value of the property. 
21 
9. 
Beginning on or about April 5, 2001, a billboard was operated on the property under 
22 the Billboard Lease. The original billboard sublessee was Melven Genser Outdoor, Inc. (""Genser""), 
23 which operated the billboard until about May 1, 2010. At that time, Osik's predecessor-in-interest, 
24 Outdoor Specialists, LLC (""OSL""), bought the billboard structure and Genser's rights under the 
25 Billboard Lease. Osik was formed in the expectation that a partner would join OS L's principal Nick 
26 Petralia in a business that included OSL's. That did not happen, but having announced the formation 
27 of Osik, Mr. Petralia conducted the business of OSL under the Osik name. OSL was dissolved in 
28 2017.

10. 
By a September 12, 2019 Amendment between GCI and Osik, the term of the 
2 Billboard Lease, which otherwise would have expired in 2021, was extended to December 31, 2027. 
3 The Amendment further provided (i-1 4) that GCI's rights in the property derive from the Ground 
4 Lease. And ""if for any reason the ground lease is terminated ... all rights of Lessee under the 
5 [Billboard] Lease shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect contemporaneous 
6 with termination"" of the Ground Lease. 
7 
11. 
OSL began operating the billboard under a Purchase and Assignment Agreement 
8 with Genser on or about May 1, 2010. On September 12, 2019, Osik and GCI entered into an 
9 Amendment of the Billboard Lease. The billboard was an open and notorious use of the property. At 
10 all relevant times, RSL therefore had imputed knowledge of the billboard and the Billboard Lease. 
11 In 2016, RSL's principal Randy Garrity saw the billboard but made no effort to determine who was 
12 operating it or to learn about the Billboard Lease. The property leased under the Billboard Lease was 
13 only the billboard itself, which was an improvement to the property. Paragraph 18 of the Ground 
14 Lease provided that the landlord's consent was not necessary for subleases of improvements. At no 
15 time did RSL notify Osik that it was terminating the Billboard Lease for lack of consent. 
16 
12. 
In 2019, a dispute arose between RSL and GCI about how the property was to be 
17 valued for adjustment of the Ground Lease rent. In the 60 years the Ground Lease had been in 
18 effect, conditions had changed dramatically. The 8300 property was now worth more as raw land 
19 than it was with the hotel and other improvements on it. Under RSL's valuation approach, which 
20 excluded the improvements, an appraiser valued the property at $61 million. Under GCI/F's 
21 approach, which valued the property as a leased fee, the value was $11 million. The resulting rent 
22 disparity was about $4.9 million under RSL's formula vs. $880,000 under GCI's. 
23 
13. 
The parties were unable to resolve their dispute and filed suit against each other. On 
24 May 28, 2020, RSL sued GCI, seeking a judicial determination that its adjustment formula was the 
25 correct one. On July 9, 2020, CGI's hotel sublessee Ferrado Hollywood, LLC brought an action 
26 challenging the RSL appraiser's method. On December 4, 2020, the court issued an interim adopting 
27 RSL's valuation method.

DEFENDANT AND CROSS-COMPLAINANT OSIK MEDIA'S CROSS-COMPLAINT 
Case 2:22-cv-08670-WLH-AS     Document 14     Filed 01/10/23     Page 22 of 36   Page ID
#:92
14. 
By February 2021, RSL claimed a total of over $6 million in unpaid rent. But RSL 
2 didn't take the obvious step to terminate the Ground Lease. To effect a forfeiture of a lease for 
3 nonpayment of rent the landlord must serve the tenant with a notice to pay or quit. If the rent is due 
4 and owing and remains unpaid at the end of the notice period, a cause of forfeiture arises. But no 
5 cause of forfeiture arises without such a notice. The minimum such notice is three days. Paragraph 
6 
19 of the Ground Lease required 15 days' notice. Moreover, nonpayment ofrent is a curable breach. 
7 RSL thus was required to serve a pay-or-quit notice on Osik as well as GCI and Ferrado RSL never 
8 served a pay-or-quit notice on GCI/F or Osik. 
9 
15. 
RSL claims that GCI and Ferrado (collectively ""GCI/F"") could not pay the rent under 
10 the court-ordered formula and refused to do so. But GCI/F asserted defenses to RSL's rent claim. 
11 First, City and County rent moratoria prohibited eviction of commercial tenants for nonpayment of 
12 rent that accrued after about March 2020. GCI/F also claimed a force majeure defense to their 
13 obligations under the Ground Lease, including payment ofrent, due to Covid and its severe effects 
14 on hotels, restaurants, and bars, i.e., the types of business operated at the Standard Hotel. GCI/F had 
15 other defenses as well, including modification of the Ground Lease due to radically changed 
16 circumstances (the property now being more valuable without improvements) and possible 
17 reorganization in bankruptcy. The prospect of a digital sign on the property provided a potential 
18 income stream to pay the new rent. These defenses were never litigated or resolved. The litigation 
19 did not produce a final judgment. Instead, the parties settled in June 2021 for the usual reasons, i.e., 
20 to avoid further litigation and the costs of legal proceedings to obtain possession of the Property. 
21 
16. 
Meanwhile, in 2019 Osik submitted a design-approval application for a digital sign 
22 and a new static billboard to be placed on the property. Osik openly disclosed its application efforts, 
23 which cost over $125,000, to GCI, which Osik reasonably believed to own the property. 
24 
17. 
On March 26, 2021, Osik hit the regulatory jackpot by obtaining a design excellence 
25 award for the signs from the City. Although further discretionary City approvals were required, the 
26 award is the main hurdle in obtaining a permit for a digital sign. RSL says so itself in its marketing 
27 material for the property. Osik has a two-year window, until March 26, 2023, to submit a completed 
28 application. To do so, Osik needs owner approval, which RSL refuses to provide.

18. 
On September 3, 2021, RSL and GCI entered into an agreement (""the Termination 
2 Agreement"") in which they agreed to dismiss the litigation and terminate the Ground Lease. The 
3 litigation ended without a judicial finding that GCI had breached the Ground Lease or that RSL had 
4 the right to terminate the Ground Lease or regain possession of the property. On or about September 
5 13, 2021, RSL gave Osik notice of the Termination Agreement. RSL sent Osik a proposed short-
6 term sublease but did not demand that Osik surrender possession. 
7 
19. 
In about October 2021, having terminated the Ground Lease and - in its view -
8 disposed of the Billboard Lease, RSL put the property on the market. RSL's broker CBRE issued a 
9 sales flyer on the internet touting the design approval Osik obtained as a full permit: ""Although the 
10 site contains an existing income generating static billboard, the City of West Hollywood has 
11 awarded 8300 Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage."" The market reaction to the 
12 design approval was spectacular. In late 2021, RSL and a buyer agreed on a sale price of $120 
13 million, approximately double the property's appraised value a year earlier. 
14 
20. 
After the Termination Agreement, Osik sought to reach a long-term lease with RSL 
15 to operate the digital sign and a new static sign on the property. RSL asked for and Osik provided 
16 information on the revenue produced by the existing billboard, which RSL used in its sale 
17 negotiations. In December 2021, as RSL's demands to vacate continued, it appeared that RSL would 
18 not enter into a lease. Osik had never agreed that the Billboard Lease was terminated. In December 
19 2021, Osik cited case law to RSL that in Osik's view holds that the Termination Agreement left the 
20 Billboard Lease intact. 
21 
21. 
On January 14, 2022, RSL filed an unlawful detainer (UD) action against Osik as a 
22 limited case. The UD case is pending. On June 7, 2022, RSL filed this action for $5 million in 
23 damages, plus an additional $1 million a month and punitive damages.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Declaratory Relief) 
Osik incorporates 11 1-22 by reference as thought fully set forth herein. 
An actual controversy has arisen between the parties in relation to Osik's rights under 
28 the Billboard Lease. Osik contends that the Billboard Lease remains fully valid and in effective.

Osik further contends that even if the Billboard Lease were terminated, Osik retains ownership of 
2 the sign structure and has the right to remove it. RSL contends that the Billboard Lease has 
3 terminated has is of no further effect, and on information and belief contends that Osik has no 
4 property rights in the sign structure.

24. 
A judicial determination of the parties' rights in the Billboard Lease and the 
6 billboard is necessary and appropriate at this time so that the parties can conduct themselves in 
7 conformity with law.

25. 
26. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Unjust Enrichment) 
Osik incorporates ,i,i 1-20 by reference as thought fully set forth herein.5 
Osik contends that it is entitled to remain in possession of the billboard through the 
12 full term of the Billboard Lease at the end of 2027. In the alternative, if Osik must give up 
13 possession, it seeks monetary compensation for the undeserved windfall benefit RSL has received 
14 from the preliminary design approval Osik obtained. RSL marketed the property on the basis that a 
15 digital sign could be operated on the property. The revenue potential of such a sign is $5-7 million a 
16 year and perhaps more. As a result of Osik's design approval, the value of the property went from an 
17 appraised range of $61-75 million in 2020-2021 to over $120 million in late 2021. RSL claims that 
18 in late 2021, it entered into a ""binding contract"" to sell the property for $120 million. 
19 
27. 
RSL in justice should not be allowed to retain the full benefit Osik obtained for the 
20 property. At all times, Osik acted in good faith, in the honest and reasonable belief that it had all 
21 owner approvals necessary to proceed with the design approval application and subsequently a 
22 development agreement with the City for a digital and new static sign on the property. Until near the 
23 end of the design application process, Osik believed GCI was the property owner. Throughout the 
24 design approval process in 2019-2021, RSL was charged with knowledge of Osik's efforts, which 
25 were reflected in publicly available documents and discussed in open City hearings. But RSL chose 
26 not to find out, or to ignore, Osik's efforts. 
27 
28. 
When RSL gained actual knowledge of Osik's design application, on March 18, 2021 
28 -with all the work done and a decision by the City only a week away - RSL's lawyer wrote to Osik

saying that RSL did not authorize any permitting activity by Osik and Osik would proceed at its own 
2 risk. Osik, however, had already proceeded. There was nothing left for Osik to do but await the 
3 City's decision. 
4 
29. 
When the City's decision issued, RSL appropriated it as RSL's own and beginning 
5 later in 2021 decided to get rid of Osik and sell the property as a site for a digital sign. As alleged 
6 above, RSL emphasized in its sales material that the property had received a design excellence 
7 award from the City. As a result, the value of the property skyrocketed due to Osik's efforts that 
8 RSL now seeks to take for itself, leaving Osik with nothing.

The Court should order that RSL pay to Osika reasonable share of the additional 
10 value of the property Osik created, in an amount of $20,000,000.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Intentional Interference with Contract) 
Osik incorporates ,r,r 
1-29 above as though fully set forth herein. 
As of 2010, Osik had an existing, fully valid sublease, i.e., the Billboard Lease, with 
15 GCI. RSL knew of the Billboard Lease. RSL had constructive notice since 2001 when the billboard 
16 - which was certainly an open and notorious use - went up on the property. By its own admission, 
17 RSL's principal Randy Garrity had actual notice of the billboard in 2016, which implied the 
18 existence of the Billboard Lease. By RSL's further admission, it learned of the Billboard Lease via 
19 an email from GCI/F's counsel in March 2021. RSL thus knew that Osik was a subtenant. 
20 
33. 
The Billboard Lease contained implied covenants that required GCI to maintain the 
21 Ground Lease through the full term of the Billboard Lease, which ran through December 31, 2027. 
22 Beginning in early 2021, RSL intentionally interfered with the Billboard Lease by inducing GCI to 
23 breach it by purporting to terminate the Ground Lease, thereby in RSL's view terminating the 
24 Billboard Lease under ,r 4 of the 2019 Amendment. 
25 
34. 
As a direct and proximate result of RS L's conduct, GCI entered into the Termination 
26 Agreement, which allowed RSL to claim that the Billboard Lease was terminated. 
27 
35. 
As a direct and proximate result of RSL's wrongful conduct, Osik has been damaged 
28 in an amount of over $3 million in lost revenue on the existing static sign.

36. 
RSL's conduct was intentional and designed specifically to destroy Osik's Billboard 
2 Lease and appropriate the Billboard Lease and the design approval for RSL. RSL further acted in 
3 conscious disregard of Osik's right to notice of any claim that GCI/F had defaulted in payment of 
4 rent or any other covenant of the Ground Lease. RSL deliberately deprived Osik of the opportunity 
5 to save the Ground Lease by pursuing a development agreement for the digital sign or otherwise. 
6 RSL thus acted maliciously and in conscious disregard for Osik's legal rights. Osik therefore is 
7 entitled to an award of punitive damages according to proof.

For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

This firm represents New Tradition Media (""New Tradition""). We write on behalf of New 
Tradition, and with the permission of Osik Media, LLC (""Osik"") as well as Studio AR+D 
Architects, Inc. (""AR+D""). New Tradition, Osik and AR+D jointly own the above-referenced 
copyright, the title of which is ""The Digital Billboard."" (hereinafter, the ""Copyright""). The 
Copyright encompasses the design for a digital billboard and a new static sign and other related 
elements to be constructed at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, and adjacent property in 
Los Angeles. Hereinafter, the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. is referred to as the ""real property."" 
As described during the July 8, 2022 deposition taken in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 
22SMUD00094, for which Bret Richheimer provided testimony, Osik and New Tradition 
submitted certain design elements to the City of West Hollywood in 2019 as part of a design 
excellence screening application for new offsite signage. On March 26 2021, the City of West 
Hollywood issued a concept award based on the elements of the Copyright, including the ""creative 
vertical format and interesting dimensionality of the sign face,"" the ""elegant sign structure and 
associated sculptural connection to Hart Park,"" and the ""proposed public benefit improvements to 
Hart Park, including the physical connection and landscape materials"" (hereinafter the ""Concept 
Award""). The Concept Award is based, in part, on the elements that constitute the Copyright. 
Regardless of any ownership rights in the Concept Award conferred by the City of West 
Hollywood, the Copyright is wholly and jointly owned by New Tradition, Osik and AR+D.

The Copyright Act provides that Copyright owners have the exclusive right to reproduce 
copyrighted works, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies, to display the work and, 
among others, to license and assign the Copyright to others. The Copyright owners have not 
granted a valid license or otherwise transferred any rights in or to the Copyright to Rittersbacher 
Sunset, LLC (""RSL"") or any of RSL's agents, including but not limited to any right to reproduce, 
publish, provide, distribute, transmit, display, or otherwise make use of any portion of the 
Copyright. 
We are informed and believe that RSL has wrongfully used the Copyright in an effort to sell its 
real property at an elevated price that necessarily incorporates the Copyright as part of the sale. 
We are further informed and believe that during October 2021, RSL directed or otherwise 
authorized its real estate broker to publish a sales brochure stating that ""the City of West 
Hollywood has awarded 8300 Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage."" (See, 
www.8300sunset.com) The statement is a misrepresentation. Any rights conferred by the City of 
West Hollywood's Concept Award do not include granting rights that encompass the Copyright. 
If the allegation in RSL's Complaint in LASC Case No. 22SMCV00828, filed June 3, 2022 is to 
be believed, RSL has entered into an agreement for the sale of the real property at the value of 
""approximately $120 million"", which is almost double the valuation of the real property cited 
within RSL's May 28, 2020 Petition filed in LASC Case No. 20SMCP00165. By advertising the 
Copyrighted design, without a valid license, and falsely representing that RSL could transfer to a 
buyer of the real property certain intellectual property in addition thereto, it appears that RSL has 
and continues to engage in willful copyright infringement, which results in actual or statutory 
damages. 
Unless RSL presents a valid license before November 22, 2022, the Copyright owners expect RSL 
will do the following: 
I. Immediately cease representing that RSL owns and/or has sufficient right to any of the 
design elements encompassed within the Copyright, or any reproductions or works derived 
therefrom; 
2. Immediately inform any buyer(s) (actual or proposed) of the real property that such 
acquisition excludes the Copyright; 
3. Immediately remove any statements from the internet, any online data rooms, or other 
digital media all claims that RSL owns, holds or otherwise possesses the right to use, 
license or assign any element encompassed within the Copyright; 
4. Provide the Copyright owners with a full accounting of any revenue RSL has realized by 
using any element of the Copyright. 
We request that RSL expressly advise of its intent to comply with the above requests.

Re: 
Copyright No. VA0002326025/20?2-07-
l I 
Dear Ms. Corley, 
As you are aware, the undersigned represents Rittersbacher Sunset. LLC ( .. RSL ··), the owner of 
the real property located at 8300 Sunset Boulevard in the City of West Hollywood (the 
'·Property."" I am in receipt of your letter of November 16. 2022 and your email of November 19, 
2022 enclosing a copy of the document you registered with the United States Copyright Office 
(the ""Filing'""), referenced above. 
After reviewing both. it appears that you have been 
misinformed as to the true facts and circumstances surrounding the City of West Hollywood·s 
digital sign program and our client's, Rittersbacher Sunset, LLC., intentions in that regard. You 
also appear to misinterpret the legal rights related to issuance of discretionary municipal permits 
related to land use generally and with regard to digital billboards, specifically. 
Preliminarily, neither your client, New Tradition Media, nor its partner Osik Media, LLC 
(""Osik""), were entitled to apply for. let alone receive. a Concept Award under the Sunset Arts & 
Advertising Program. A tenant (let alone a sub-tenant at sufferance) has no rights to a land use 
entitlement in the City of West Hollywood (the ·•City""'). When issued, the rights derived from 
land use authorization ·'run with the land·· and grant rights solely to the property owner. 
It is 
clear from the rules and regulations of the City of West Hollywood that an applicant for a 
Concept Award, land use entitlement or construction permit can only be issued to the property 
owner and the property owner must expressly authorize such an application. 
The only reason that the application submitted by Osik was accepted by the City for 
consideration was the misrepresentation in the application that the property owner was Golden 
Crest, Inc. and that it had given consent to the filing of the application. Golden Crest is not and 
never was the owner of the property. RSL was never consulted or asked for its authorization to 
file such an application and did not do so. RSL was not even aware of your clients· illicit actions 
until the City informed them that they could not proceed without the authorization of the 
property owner. Once the City discovered the misrepresentation. it is my understanding that 
staff declined to deal further with your clients. The fact that the City could have voided the

application and instead elected to allow the landowner to continue can conjure no rights to your 
clients. 
The Concept Award does not constitute approval to do anything other than to apply for 
permission for a digital billboard. 
The Concept Award does not constitute approval of design 
and any design submitted would have to be approved by various elected and appointed officials 
of the City. And, the design as submitted with the application, in fact, cannot and never could be 
approved by the City. It is apparent that the designs proposed requires use of an adjacent park. 
That park, however, was not the property of West Hollywood and that the City could not issue 
any permits for the use of that property by your client. 
Once that element of the design is 
eliminated, all that is left is a rectangular sign similar to numerous other billboards on the Sunset 
Strip. I trust your client and its partner do not claim a propriety interest in a basic. rectangular 
geometric shape. 
Your letter suggests that your clients are entitled to exclusive use of the submission to the City of 
West Hollywood as a result of the Filing the United States Copyright Office. The Filing offers 
no support for your clients claims. A registration, often colloquially referred to as a copyright, 
actually grants no unique rights. Rather, it represents receipt by the Copyright Office of a claim 
to a particular fonn of expression. The Copyright Office does not evaluate or validate any claim 
to copyright. 
It simply confirms receipt of the proffered material in accordance with its 
procedural requirements. 
In this case, the Registration itself confim1s that it has no relevance to this matter. It reflects on 
its face that the application was submitted on July 11, 2022. The events to which you refer in 
your letter all preceded that dates. As such, the Filing has no bearing to our discussion. 
It is also notable that the timing of the registration coincides with events in the unlawful detainer 
and civil litigation between Osik and RSL. In particular, RSL • s complaint against Osik for 
damages was filed on June 3, 2022. Your registration was submitted the following month. It 
would appear that your client only decided to assert a copyright claim for tactical reasons and to 
further interfere with our clients pending sale of the Property and in furtherance of its efforts to 
illicitly extricate substantial sums from RSL. 
Even if a copyright to the materials existed, which is disputed by my client, there are exemptions 
in the law, too numerous to discuss here, that precludes its application under the circumstances 
presented. 
However, it is unnecessary to discuss them further at this time due to my clients 
response below to the questions posed in your letter. 
Without any legal obligation to do so, RSL, in order to avoid the waste of time and resources by 
all parties, responds to your questions, as follow: 
1. RSL has not and does not intend to represent that it owns the subject of the registration 
with the Copyright Office.

2. RSL has not and does not intend to represent to any person that it has the right to grant 
permission to build a billboard as depicted in the material submitted to the Copyright 
Office. 
3. No representations have been made that a sale of the Property would include the rights to 
copyrighted materials 
4. To our knowledge there are no statements on the internet, any online data rooms, or other 
digital media that RSL claims to own, hold or possess the right to use, license or assign 
the materials submitted to the Copyright Office. 
5. RSL has not and does not intend to construct a billboard based upon the materials 
submitted to the Copyright Otlice. 
Nothing herein shall be deemed an acknowledgment that your clients or those acting in concert 
with them, have any rights under the copyright laws of the United States or the State of 
California with respect to Materials. 
This contents of this letter are not an exhaustive or 
comprehensive list of my client's rights with regard to with respect to the alleged copyright 
material, its use of the Property, its legal rights or the remedies has with respect to your clients 
and its partners' conduct, including but not limited to their interference with the sale of the 
Property or the lawful processes of the City of West Hollywood. All rights and remedies are 
expressly reserved. 
I trust that the foregoing sufficiently addresses your client's unfounded belief that the Materials 
will be used without consent of its owners and resolved the questions raised in your letter. 
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

COMPLAINT 
Plaintiffs Lucas Bolaño (“Bolaño”) and Julio Drove Pamart (“Drove Pamart”) 
(together, “Plaintiffs”), demanding trial by jury, complain and allege as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
1.
Bolaño is an experimental musician based in Madrid, Spain.  He is
known for creating vivid soundscapes and sound art.  Bolaño performs individually 
and as Experimental Little Monkey (“ELM”).  Drove Pamart is also a Madrid-based 
director and filmmaker who focuses on experimental short films. 
2.
In 2009, Plaintiffs collaborated on a short film titled SKY, which
features various cloudscapes set to the song “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” by ELM. 
Towards the end of the film, a distinctive voice can be heard saying “Remember, I 
will always love you, bye” as clouds shift across the sunset. 
3.
Three years later, world renowned pop star Lana Del Rey lifted that
portion of SKY and used it in the official music video for her mega-hit single 
“Summertime Sadness” (the “Music Video”)—without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or 
consent.  In blatant disregard for Plaintiffs’ intellectual property rights, the first 17 
seconds of the Music Video are copied directly from SKY (which incorporates the 
sound recording “Strange Dumpling Cheeks”).  Defendants do not even try to hide 
their unauthorized copying and use the phrase “Remember, I will always love you, 
bye” as the thematic underpinning for the entire Music Video. 
4.
When Plaintiffs discovered the infringement, they immediately sent
Defendants a cease-and-desist letter. 
5.
To date, however, the Music Video remains on YouTube, where it
continues to generate significant income for Defendants.  Plaintiffs were left with no 
choice but to bring this action against Defendants for their acts of willful and 
contributory copyright infringement in violation of the United States Copyright Act, 
as codified in 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.

COMPLAINT 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
6.
This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ copyright claims under 28
U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, and 1338. 
7.
Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (c),
and 28 U.S.C. § 1400(a) because the claims arise in this Judicial District and the 
Defendants transact business in this Judicial District. 
PARTIES 
8.

of their co-defendants. 
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 
Plaintiffs’ Works 
21.
In 2008, Bolaño created a song titled “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” by
ELM.  At the end of the track, a distinctive woman’s voice can be heard clearly 
saying “Remember, I will always love you, bye.”  The song was then used as the 
title track for ELM’s album of the same name.  The album was initially published on 
compact discs and later uploaded to ELM’s Bandcamp page for commercial 
distribution.  It is widely disseminated and accessible across a variety of platforms.  
Bolaño is the sole and exclusive owner of all copyrights in the work “Strange 
Dumpling Cheeks.” 
22.
In 2009, Bolaño collaborated with Drove Pamart on a short film called
SKY.  As the title suggests, SKY contains Super 8 film footage of various cloud 
formations set to ELM’s song “Strange Dumpling Cheeks.”  In 2009, Drove Pamart 
uploaded the 3 minute and 29 second long video to YouTube for distribution, which 
can be viewed at the following link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j420Y56jOMA. 
23.
Between minute 3:09 and 3:26, the distinctive female voice can be
heard saying “Remember, I will always love you, bye” as clouds shift across the 
sunset.  The film then ends with a black-and-white credit screen attributing the

Defendants’ Work 
24.
The studio version of Grant’s “Summertime Sadness” was released by
Interscope Records on June 22, 2012 as the fourth single off her album Born to Die 
(2012).  The song was an instant hit, reaching number one on charts across the 
globe. 
25.
The official Music Video was then published on YouTube on August
23, 2013 through UMG’s video hosting service Vevo, and can be accessed at the 
following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrL3QxjyVw.  The Music 
Video was directed by Kyle Newman and Spencer Susser.  Spencer Susser is also 
credited as the “film editor,” while his brother, Morgan Spencer, is credited as the 
cinematographer. 
26.
The first 17 seconds of Grant’s music video are copied directly from
the 3:09 and 3:26 minute marks of SKY.  Indeed, Defendants simply took this 17 
second clip from SKY, and used it as an introduction to Grant’s official Music 
Video—without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent and without paying Plaintiffs 
anything.  The only marginal differences are that Defendants appear to have 
saturated the colors and cropped Plaintiffs’ footage, as shown below:

COMPLAINT 
27.
But these minor alterations do not make Defendants’ copying any less
apparent or egregious.  At the 13 second mark of the music video, listeners can hear 
the same distinctive voice saying “Remember, I will always love you, bye” before 
the screen cuts black and “Summertime Sadness” begins to play.  That phrase, and 
the footage from SKY, are critical to Grant’s work since they set the tone and feel for 
the entire music video, which is filmed in a similar way and depicts a young couple 
reminiscing on happier times before committing suicide.  This tone and feel has 
garnered many favorable reviews from music critics and fans alike.  To date, the 
music video has 357,359,116 views on YouTube and, on information and belief, has 
generated millions of dollars in royalties on the backs of Plaintiffs’ art.   
28.
Unfortunately, Plaintiffs have not seen a dime of these ill-gotten
proceeds and have never even been credited for their work.  Although YouTube 
indicates that the Music Video was licensed to YouTube by a host of different 
entities, none of them had a right to use or exploit “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” or 
SKY because Plaintiffs never licensed their works to any of these entities.1 
1 Specifically, YouTube indicates that the Music Video was “[l]icensed to YouTube

COMPLAINT 
29.
Plaintiffs raised their concerns in a letter demanding that Defendants
cease and desist from further infringing their copyrights. 
30.
To date, however, the Music Video remains on YouTube, where it
continues to generate significant income for Defendants. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
Copyright Infringement (Count I) 
(Plaintiff Bolaño against all Defendants) 
31.
All previous allegations are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference. 
32.
Bolaño is the sole and exclusive owner of the entire copyright in the
work “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” (Reg. No. SR 928-275), which is an original 
work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. 
33.
Bolaño has not granted any license or otherwise permitted Defendants
to use his copyrighted material. 
34.
The Music Video, which was created by Defendants, directly copies
approximately 17 seconds of “Strange Dumpling Cheeks.”  The Music Video was 
and continues to be available on YouTube at the following link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrL3QxjyVw. 
35.
Defendants had direct access to “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” since it
was published and made publicly available on ELM’s Bandcamp page. Regardless, 
Defendants used Bolaño’s exact sound recording in their work, eliminating any 
by UMG (on behalf of Polydor Records); LatinAutorPerf, UMPI, LatinAutor - 
SonyATV, UNIAO BRASILEIRA DE EDITORAS DE MUSICA - UBEM, Global 
Music Rights LLC, SOLAR Music Rights Management, CMRRA, Sony ATV 
Publishing, UMPG Publishing, Adrev Publishing, LatinAutor - UMPG, and 13 
Music Rights Societies.”  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrL3QxjyVw.  
Plaintiffs reserve the right to name these entities as parties to this lawsuit once their 
roles in creating, distributing, or otherwise contributing to the Music Video have 
been ascertained by Plaintiffs.

As such, Defendants have violated and are continuing to violate
Bolaño’s exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501, including but not limited 
to Bolaño’s exclusive rights to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, and 
perform his work “Strange Dumpling Cheeks.” 
37.
As an actual and proximate result of such copyright infringement, as
described herein, Bolaño has suffered and will continue to suffer damages in an 
amount to be proven at trial. 
38.
Defendants’ copyright infringement was committed maliciously,
fraudulently, and oppressively with willful and conscious disregard of Bolaño’s 
rights and with the wrongful intent to injure Bolaño. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
Copyright Infringement (Count II) 
(Plaintiff Drove Pamart against all Defendants) 
39.
All previous allegations are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference. 
40.
Drove Pamart is the sole and exclusive owner of the entire copyright in
the audiovisual work SKY (Reg. No. PAu 4-136-898), which is an original work of 
authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. 
41.
Drove Pamart has not granted any license or otherwise permitted
Defendants to Defendants to use his copyrighted material. 
42.
The Music Video, which was created by Defendants, directly copies
approximately 17 seconds of SKY.  The Music Video was and continues to be 
available on YouTube at the following link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrL3QxjyVw. 
43.
If not directly copied (which it was) the Music Video is so strikingly
similar to Drove Pamart’s copyrighted material that independent creation is virtually 
impossible.

Defendants had direct access to SKY since it was uploaded and made

video in their work, eliminating any potential defense based on lack of access. 
45.
As such, Defendants have violated and are continuing to violate Drove
Pamart’s exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501, including but not limited 
to Drove Pamart’s exclusive rights to reproduce, prepare derivative works, 
distribute, and display copies of his work SKY. 
46.
As an actual and proximate result of such copyright infringement, as
described herein, Drove Pamart has suffered and will continue to suffer damages in 
an amount to be proven at trial. 
47.
Defendants’ copyright infringement was committed maliciously,
fraudulently, and oppressively with willful and conscious disregard of Drove 
Pamart’s rights and with the wrongful intent to injure Drove Pamart. 
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
Contributory Copyright Infringement 
(Plaintiffs against Defendants Newman, Spencer, Morgan, Dann, Foster, and 
Does 1 through 10) 
48.
All previous allegations are realleged and incorporated herein by
reference. 
49.
To the extent Newman, Spencer, Morgan, Dann, Foster, and/or Does 1
through 10 did not directly infringe Plaintiffs’ works, Plaintiffs are informed and 
believe that these parties induced, caused, and/or materially contributed to the 
infringing activity described herein by permitting and encouraging Defendants to 
directly copy “Strange Dumpling Cheeks” and SKY. 
50.
Newman, Spencer, Morgan, Dann, Foster, and/or Does 1 through 10
each knew or had reason to know that materially contributing to Defendants’ use of 
Plaintiffs’ copyrighted material for purposes of trade would contribute to 
infringement of Plaintiff’s copyrighted material.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
(COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT) 
(17 U.S.C. §§ 106, 501)

5. 
On information and belief, the Sutton firm and Ezra Sutton

COMPLAINT 
 
infringement by patent trolls and other entities that Newegg believes abuse the 
patent laws by targeting end-users and resellers of technology. 
9. 
Newegg routinely and aggressively defends itself from patent 
infringement suits that it believes to be meritless and abusive in nature.  In doing 
so, and based on mutual agreements, Newegg and Newegg’s outside counsel 
frequently collaborate with other defendants and their respective outside counsel to 
achieve common goals.   
10. 
Newegg incurs considerable expenses in attorney’s fees, costs, and 
other resources to defend itself from meritless lawsuits. 
11. 
Newegg, Newegg.com, Inc., and Rosewill, Inc. (collectively, “the 
Newegg Companies”), along with Sakar International, Inc. (“Sakar”) and 56 other 
defendants, were sued by Adjustacam, LLC (“Adjustacam”) in July, 2010 in the 
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for alleged patent infringement 
(“the Adjustacam litigation”). 
12. 
All defendants other than the Newegg Companies and Sakar settled 
with Adjustacam well before trial and were dismissed. 
13. 
Defendants represented Sakar in the Adjustacam litigation.   
14. 
Adjustacam moved to dismiss its cases against the Newegg 
Companies and Sakar, and the District Court granted its motions.  The Newegg 
Companies and Sakar each then moved for attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 35 
U.S.C. § 285 and 28 U.S.C. § 1920. 
15. 
The District Court denied the Newegg Companies’ and Sakar’s 
motions for attorney’s fees.  Both the Newegg Companies and Sakar separately 
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“the Adjustacam 
appeal”).  Newegg then began drafting its appeal brief. 
16. 
The opening appeal briefs of the Newegg Companies and Sakar were 
due on September 25, 2014.  On September 16, 2014, only nine (9) days before the 
due date, Mr. Sutton contacted Newegg’s outside counsel concerning the

COMPLAINT 
 
Adjustacam appeal.  This email communication and others are attached as Exhibit 
1.   Mr. Sutton asked Newegg’s outside counsel if Newegg “need[ed] any sections 
from Sakar in order to prepare Sakar’s section of the appeal brief.”  See Exhibit 1. 
17. 
At the time of Mr. Sutton’s September 16, 2014 email, there was no 
agreement or understanding in place between Newegg and Sakar to share costs, 
attorneys, or work product in connection with the Adjustacam appeal, so Mr. 
Sutton’s request was perplexing to Newegg.  Nevertheless, Newegg’s Chief Legal 
Officer Lee Cheng spoke with Mr. Sutton about how Newegg might still be able to 
help him and Sakar regarding Sakar’s appeal brief.  Specifically, Newegg offered 
to help incorporate Sakar’s arguments into Newegg’s brief, so that a joint brief 
could be filed, if Sakar would share the legal fees incurred by Newegg.  See 
Exhibit 1.   
18. 
Mr. Sutton declined Newegg’s offer to share fees, but agreed instead 
to file only a “short brief” of approximately ten pages with Sakar-specific 
arguments and record citations so as not to be duplicative of Newegg’s brief or 
derail Newegg’s briefing process.  See Exhibit 1.  
19. 
On September 17, 2014, Newegg agreed to assist Mr. Sutton and 
Sakar by providing Mr. Sutton with a copy of the most current draft of Newegg’s 
brief specifically “for reference and resource purposes.”  See Exhibit 1.  In the 
same communication, Newegg specifically asked Mr. Sutton to agree in writing “to 
not circulate our communications or any of Newegg’s work product to any third 
party without our consent,” indicating that drafts would be provided only for Mr. 
Sutton’s reference.  See Exhibit 1.  Newegg also asked Mr. Sutton to confirm that 
Mr. Sutton “will be submitting a separate brief for Sakar”.  See Exhibit 1. 
20. 
On September 18, 2014, Mr. Sutton sent an email to Newegg 
indicating that he agreed “not to circulate any of the briefs” that Newegg agreed to 
send.  See Exhibit 1.

COMPLAINT 
 
21. 
On September 18, 2014, in reliance on Mr. Sutton’s written 
assurances, Newegg sent a copy of its draft appeal brief (“Newegg’s Draft Brief”) 
to Defendants.  A copy of Newegg’s Draft Brief, redacted for confidentiality 
purposes, is attached as Exhibit 2.   
22. 
Prior to providing Defendants with a copy of Newegg’s Draft Brief, 
Newegg and Newegg’s lead outside counsel had distributed copies of Newegg’s 
Draft Brief to other attorneys, law firms, and firm staff on Newegg’s appellate 
team for the purpose of eliciting comments and suggestions prior to filing.  
23. 
After Defendants agreed to Newegg’s express conditions and received 
Newegg’s Draft Brief, and before Newegg filed its appeal brief, Defendants filed 
an appeal brief (“Defendants’ First Brief”) with the U.S. Court of Appeals of the 
Federal Circuit on September 24, 2014.  A copy of Defendants’ First Brief is 
attached as Exhibit 3.  Defendants’ First Brief was substantially similar to 
Newegg’s Draft Brief. 
24. 
Newegg filed its appeal brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Circuit on September 25, 2014. (“Newegg’s Final Brief”).  Newegg’s Final 
Brief is substantially similar to Newegg’s Draft Brief.  Newegg’s Final Brief, 
redacted for confidentiality purposes, is attached as Exhibit 4. 
25. 
After discovering that Defendants’ First Brief was nearly identical to 
Newegg’s Draft Brief, Newegg sent a letter to the Honorable Daniel E. O’Toole, 
Clerk of Court for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, on September 
29, 2014 explaining the circumstances so as not to unnecessarily burden the Court 
with duplicative briefing.   
26. 
Newegg also demanded that Sakar withdraw its brief and replace it 
with the “short brief” Mr. Sutton had originally agreed to file, which would not 
include Newegg’s original work product.   
27. 
In response to Newegg’s request, Defendants moved to withdraw 
Defendants’ First Brief on October 14, 2014 and filed a shorter, revised appeal

COMPLAINT 
 
brief on behalf of Sakar on October 15, 2014 (“Defendants’ Second Brief”).  A 
copy of Defendants’ Second Brief, redacted for confidentiality purposes, is 
attached as Exhibit 5.  Defendants’ Second Brief still includes a considerable 
amount of material from Newegg’s Draft Brief.  See Exhibits 2 and 5. 
28. 
Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief were authored by 
Newegg, The Webb Law Firm, P.C., Latham & Watkins LLP, Weil, Gotshal & 
Manges LLP, and McDermott Will & Emery LLP (collectively, “the Authors”).  
Newegg owns the exclusive rights in Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final 
Brief and all derivative works thereof by way of written assignment from the 
Authors.   
29. 
Newegg’s Draft Brief was registered with the United States Copyright 
Office on October 20, 2014 as Registration No. TXU001911314.  A copy of the 
Certificate of Registration is attached as Exhibit 6.   
30. 
Newegg’s Final Brief was submitted to the United States Copyright 
Office for registration on October 24, 2014. 
31. 
Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief are expressive works 
of authorship that present legal argument, policy justifications, and a summary of 
the Adjustacam litigation in a manner uniquely attributable to Newegg and its 
outside counsel. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
32. 
Newegg re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference each and 
every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 31 of this Complaint as if fully 
set forth herein. 
33. 
Newegg owns own all right, title, and interest in and to the copyrights 
for Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief, and is the owner of a valid 
United States Copyright Registration for Newegg’s Draft Brief.  See Exhibit 6. 
34. 
Newegg never authorized Defendants to reproduce or distribute either

COMPLAINT 
 
Newegg’s Draft Brief or Newegg’s Final Brief. 
35. 
Defendants had access to Newegg’s Draft Brief after being provided 
the same by Newegg “for reference and resource purposes” on September 18, 
2014.  See Exhibit 1.   
36. 
On information and belief, Defendants had access to Newegg’s Final 
Brief as of September 25, 2014, the date it was filed with the Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit. 
37. 
Defendants’ First Brief, as it was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit on September 25, 2014, is substantially similar to Newegg’s 
Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief.   See Exhibits 2, 3, and 4. 
38. 
Defendants’ First Brief is a verbatim copy of Newegg’s Draft Brief 
with the exception that the references to “Newegg” are replaced with references to 
“Sakar,” and a few other minor edits.  The copying is so extensive that even certain 
typographical errors in Newegg’s Draft Brief appeared in Defendants’ First Brief.  
See Exhibits 2 and 3. 
39. 
Defendants’ Second Brief includes a substantial portion of 
Defendants’ First Brief, and therefore includes portions that are substantially 
similar to Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief.  See Exhibits 2 and 5. 
40. 
On information and belief, Defendants knowingly, willfully, and 
intentionally infringed, and continues to infringe, the copyrights of Newegg’s Draft 
Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief. 
41. 
The aforementioned acts of Defendants violate Newegg’s exclusive 
rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106 to reproduce, distribute, and prepare derivative works 
of Newegg’s Draft Brief and Newegg’s Final Brief, and constitutes willful, 
deliberate, and ongoing infringement of Newegg’s copyrights in the same. 
42. 
As the direct result of Defendants’ infringing actions as herein 
alleged, Newegg has been irreparably, materially, and substantially harmed and 
damaged.

Subject: URGENT: Adjustacam Appeal -- Sakar International 
Dear Ezra— 
Dan Brean of the Webb law firm indicated that you asked the Parsons Behle firm if Sakar can 
add material to our Adjustacam appellate brief. I’m not aware of any agreement between 
Newegg/Sakar to share counsel or work on the Adjustacam appeal. We are not aware of any 
effort by Sakar to engage the Webb firm to do any work for Sakar or any discussions relating to 
joint defense, and no one ever contacted us or Webb about joint representation in this matter. 
To the extent that Sakar is interested in sharing work and costs, I expect Sakar to fund fully half 
the costs of the work and at this point, given the amount of work put in by Newegg and its 
outside counsel to prepare a compelling brief and oral argument, to minimize its editorial 
contribution. I expect Sakar to pay in full as we will not further subsidize work that they benefit 
from. 
Can you arrange an all-hands’ call in the tomorrow—I’d like to have a conversation with all 
hands’—clients and outside counsel. Again, I am instructing Webb to not regard Sakar as a client 
or to include any Sakar material until that discussion takes place and an agreement and 
arrangement is reached. 
Thanks.
Best,
Lee Cheng 
Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary

Our firm is no longer representing Newegg in this appeal, and we will be filing a motion to

STATEMENT OF RELATED CASES 
 
No other appeal in or from this same civil action was previously before this 
Court or any other court of appeals.  Newegg Inc., Newegg.com, Inc., and 
Rosewill, Inc. (collectively, “Newegg” or “the Newegg Defendants”) and their 
undersigned counsel are unaware of any other actions now pending in this or any 
other court that will directly affect or be directly affected by this Court’s decision 
in the present appeal.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT 
 
Newegg’s Cross-Appeal: 
The district court had original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1338(a).  Newegg filed a timely and proper notice of appeal under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4.  This Court has appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 
AdjustaCam’s Appeal: 
For reasons discussed below, this Court does not have subject matter 
jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s appeal and AdjustaCam’s appeal must be 
dismissed. 
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES 
 
 
1. 
Whether the district court erred by failing to find this case exceptional 
and egregious under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and its inherent authority to award Newegg 
its attorneys’ fees and expert fees, despite clear and unrebutted evidence showing 
that this lawsuit was meritless, and that it was filed and prosecuted to leverage the 
high cost and burden of litigation to coerce a nuisance-value settlement payment 
from Newegg. 
 
2. 
Whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s 
appeal, given that the case on the merits was mutually and voluntarily dismissed in 
its entirety, and no case or controversy remains between the parties.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
AdjustaCam, LLC (“AdjustaCam”) brought this action in July 2010 against 
59 defendants, including the Newegg Defendants, alleging that certain camera 
products sold by Newegg infringed United States Patent No. 5,885,343 (“the ’343 
Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”  A0004.  The ’343 Patent is owned by Global-
Media Group, LLC and AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of the patent.  
A1789. 
Immediately after filing suit AdjustaCam began seeking to settle with the 
defendants for amounts far below the cost of defense.  All defendants other than 
the Newegg Defendants and Sakar International, Inc. (“Sakar”) settled with 
AdjustaCam well before trial and were dismissed.  A0004.  Generally, each 
defendant paid 
 and, in many cases, 
 as a 
settlement fee, and always as a round number.  A1282. 
A Markman hearing was held on February 9, 2012 to construe various claim 
terms of the ’343 Patent.  A0013.  Magistrate Judge Love issued a Markman order 
on April 10, 2012, which was subsequently adopted in full by Chief Judge Davis 
on June 7, 2012.  A0013-27; A0012 (“the Markman Order”).   
Among the terms addressed in the Markman Order was the term “[r]otatably 
attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach.” A0020-
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 24 of 242   Page ID #:24
 
3 
23.  The parties disputed whether the term as used in the claims “allow[s] for a 
‘rotatably attached’ object to rotate over more than a single axis.”  A0020.  The 
district court agreed with the defendants, noting that “[t]he claims plainly describe 
each ‘rotatably attached’ object as rotating about a single axis.”  A0022.1  The 
district court also explained that “[e]very reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object 
in the specification and claims describes the attachment as permitting motion over 
a single axis of rotation.”  A0021.  Although the term “did not require 
construction,” the district court nonetheless resolved the claim interpretation 
dispute, holding that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are limited 
to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23 (prohibiting the parties from contradicting 
the district court’s resolution of the dispute as the case went forward). 
In the few months following the Markman Order, AdjustaCam quickly 
proceeded to seek to dismiss all remaining defendants from the case, most of 
whom agreed to the dismissal and sought no relief from AdjustaCam.  A0147-53 
(dismissing Amazon.com, Auditek, Digital Innovations, CDW, etc.).  These 
                                                 
1 As the district court explained (A0020), the claims of the ’343 Patent referred 
consistently to a “rotatably attached” hinge member rotating in only one of two 
specific axes of rotation, depending on whether it was rotating with respect to the 
camera or the support frame.  See, e.g., Claim 1 (“a hinge member adapted to be 
rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge member is so 
attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge member”); 
(“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . said hinge member 
rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support frame, said first axis 
of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis of rotation”).

companies generally paid AdjustaCam 
 to be dismissed 
from the lawsuit—again, always as a round number.  A1282. 
On August 27, 2012, after considerable expert discovery was completed and 
the case was on the verge of summary judgment and Daubert proceedings, 
AdjustaCam filed a motion to dismiss its claims against the Newegg Defendants 
with prejudice.  A2136-37.  The motion also sought to dismiss the Newegg 
Defendants’ invalidity and non-infringement declaratory judgment counterclaims 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, with prejudice, based on a covenant not to 
sue that extinguished the case or controversy with respect to the counterclaims.  Id.  
According to AdjustaCam, the reason for its motion was that it had “recently 
resolved its claims against almost all of the remaining Defendants,” including 
defendants whose products were sold by Newegg, such that “NewEgg/Rosewill is 
no longer selling unlicensed webcams manufactured by any other Defendant.”  
A2137.  Thus, AdjustaCam professed a “desire[] to simplify this case by focusing 
its claims going forward solely upon Defendant Sakar and Defendant Kohl’s, 
which is accused of infringement solely on account of Sakar manufactured 
products.  NewEgg/Rosewill’s remaining damages exposure . . . is relatively de 
minimis, and is dwarfed by the damages exposure of Sakar.”  A2137-38. 
Newegg opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that its declaratory 
judgment counterclaims should not be dismissed with prejudice.  A2093-95 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 26 of 242   Page ID #:26
 
5 
(explaining that “the covenant not to sue offered by AdjustaCam lacks certain 
critical elements required to protect Newegg from charges of infringement by 
AdjustaCam or its successors regarding future Newegg products”).  AdjustaCam 
subsequently filed a new, unopposed motion that sought to dismiss its infringement 
claims with prejudice and Newegg’s counterclaims without prejudice, which the 
district court granted.  A1986-87; A155. 
Newegg then filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, which was 
denied.  A0156, A0160.  Newegg also submitted an unopposed bill of costs in the 
amount of $8,492.66, but when the district court entered final judgment, the 
judgment did not reflect Newegg’s unopposed costs, erroneously stating that “all 
costs are to be borne by the party that incurred them.”  A0199-200, A0001-03.   
Newegg moved the district court to amend the erroneous judgment, A0199-
200, but when the correction was not made before the appeal deadline Newegg 
filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the denial of its motion for attorneys’ 
fees.  A0160; A0195.   AdjustaCam filed a separate notice of appeal the same day, 
seeking review of the district court’s claim construction order.  A0193.  Although 
AdjustaCam’s notice of appeal also referred to the district court’s final judgment, 
that final judgment was not premised on any claim construction issues, nor did 
AdjustaCam seek a consent judgment incorporating the claim construction order as 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 27 of 242   Page ID #:27
 
6 
the basis for a judgment of non-infringement.  Rather, the final judgment merely 
reflected the parties’ agreed mutual dismissal of the case.  A0001-03; A1986-87. 
The appeals were docketed by this Court but then deactivated due to 
Newegg’s pending motion to correct the judgment.  Dkt. No. 17.  When the district 
court had still not decided Newegg’s motion to correct the judgment after six 
months, Newegg withdrew the motion, deciding to forego its costs to avoid further 
delay of this appeal.  A0162.  This Court subsequently reactivated the appeal.  Dkt. 
No. 20. 
Meanwhile, after Newegg had withdrawn its motion to correct the judgment, 
and shortly before this appeal was reactivated, the Supreme Court decided Octane 
Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 (2014), which 
relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Unable to squeeze a nuisance-value settlement payment from Newegg after 
more than two years of litigation, patent assertion entity AdjustaCam decided it 
would rather dismiss Newegg with prejudice than risk the inevitability that this 
case would be resolved on the merits in Newegg’s favor.   
AdjustaCam never genuinely believed that Newegg infringed its patent, nor 
reasonably could it—the ’343 Patent covers adjustable cameras with very precisely 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 28 of 242   Page ID #:28
 
7 
defined axes of rotation that are facially absent from Newegg’s accused products.  
Even after the district court emphatically rejected AdjustaCam’s attempt to 
sidestep its patent’s claim language, AdjustaCam pressed on with the case and 
made overreaching and unsupportable nuisance-value settlement demands.  
Finally, when summary judgment briefing was underway and trial was looming, 
AdjustaCam, having already obtained settlement payments from almost all other 
defendants, cut and ran to avoid putting its patents in jeopardy and thus preserve its 
shakedown business.   
The filing and prosecution of this action by AdjustaCam was solely intended 
to extort nuisance-value settlement fees from defendants, not to resolve any 
legitimate claims of infringement or damages.  Such a baseless case that abuses the 
judiciary for personal gain is exceptional and warrants fee shifting. 
By the time Newegg filed its motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, 
AdjustaCam had forced Newegg to spend more than $350,000 in attorneys’ fees 
and expert fees to defend itself.  A1793-94.  Newegg contends that it should not 
have to bear these fees. 
II. The Parties 
 
AdjustaCam is a limited liability company that is exclusively in the business 
of patent litigation.  As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acacia Research Group, 
LLC, its business follows the all-too-familiar model of using the burden and 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 29 of 242   Page ID #:29

expense of patent litigation as leverage to extort settlement fees from defendants.  
A1779. 
Newegg is an online-only retailer that primarily sells computers, computer 
components and peripherals, and consumer electronics.  Newegg conducts its 
business via www.newegg.com.  Rosewill is Newegg’s private-label brand for 
certain products.  Rosewill does not manufacture its products, but simply purchases 
and re-sells its products under its “Rosewill” brand name. 
A large number of AdjustaCam’s target defendants in this case were 
successful online retailers like Amazon.com and Newegg, who simply purchased 
and re-sold the accused cameras, not manufacturers who actually made the accused 
cameras. 
III. 
AdjustaCam’s Infringement Allegations 
 
AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of United States Patent No. 5,855,343 
(“the ’343 Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”   A1789.   The ’343 Patent is generally 
directed to a camera clip that supports a camera when sitting on a flat surface or 
when attached to an object, such as a computer monitor: 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 30 of 242   Page ID #:30

’343 Patent, Figs. 1, 2, 4.  The clip allows the camera to rotate in two distinct 
directions about distinct axes of rotation. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 31 of 242   Page ID #:31
 
10 
First, as shown in Fig. 1, the camera can be rotated to pan side-to-side.  The 
specification explains: “[h]inge member 16 is rotatably attached to camera 12, 
where camera 12 rotates over a first axis 26 in a direction shown by arrow 28 
relative to hinge member 16.”  ’343 Patent, at 4:17-19.  Second, as shown in Fig. 2, 
the camera can be tilted upward and downward.  The specification explains: 
“[h]inge member 16 rotates over a second axis 32 in the direction shown by arrow 
34 relative to support frame 18.  First axis 26 is perpendicular to second axis 32.”  
 ’343 Patent, at 4:21-24. 
 
These particular axes of rotation are expressly required by all independent 
claims in the ’343 Patent.  See, e.g., ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“a hinge member 
adapted to be rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge 
member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge 
member”); id (“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . , said 
hinge member rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support 
frame, said first axis of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis 
of rotation”).2   
To be clear, the camera products claimed in the ’343 Patent require three 
distinct components of importance to this case: (1) a camera; (2) a hinge member; 
and (3) a support frame. While the camera product—including the hinge

11 
member—rotates about two axes, the camera of the ’343 Patent itself only rotates 
about one axis; this is what is described, and this is what is claimed. This is evident 
from the claim language, which specifies that the camera is “rotatably attached” to 
the hinge member of the claimed apparatus such that the camera rotates about a 
single axis of rotation (the claimed “first axis of rotation”).  Similarily, the support 
frame of the apparatus is itself “rotatably attached” to the hinge member such that 
the support frame rotates relative to the hinge member about a separate, single axis 
of rotation (the claimed “second axis of rotation”). Importantly, the two axes of 
rotation with respect to the three components are distinct, and are distinctly 
claimed.  Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the term “[r]otatably 
attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach” as used in 
the claims indicated that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are 
limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  
Unlike the camera covered by the ’343 Patent, AdjustaCam accused 
products do not rotate about a single axis of rotation. Instead, these products (the 
“Accused Ball-and-Socket Products”) include a camera connected to a support 
frame via a ball-and-socket joint, which facilitates rotation about multiple axes. 
This continues substantial and material differences between the Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products and the ’343 Patent claims, as illustrated by the 
following photographs of the accused Rosewill RCM-8163 (below left) and 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 33 of 242   Page ID #:33
 
12 
Hercules Classic (below right) webcams, which are representative of the Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products: 
 
A1786; see also A1755-75.  The nature of these ball-and-socket joints is that they 
allow for rotation for each of the parts of the camera product about multiple axes—
the camera is able to spin and pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to 
the socket (not just a single axis), and the support frame is likewise able to spin and 
pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to the ball (not just a single axis).  
A1755-75.  Comparing the accused products to the claims and specification of the 
’343 Patent shows that AdjustaCam’s infringement allegations were baseless.   
Another key reason the ’343 Patent claims do not map to the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products is the fact that, unlike the three distinct components claimed 
in the ’343 Patent, the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products have only two distinct 
components of importance to this case: (1) a camera; and (2) a support frame.  The 
use of a ball-and-socket joint between these two components eliminates the need 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 34 of 242   Page ID #:34
 
13 
for a third element—an intermediate hinge member—as claimed in the ’343 
Patent.  A ball-and-socket camera is simply an inapt product to accuse of 
infringement given the precisely claimed three-part camera of the ’343 Patent and 
its limited rotation capabilities.  The Accused Ball-and-Socket Products work in a 
fundamentally different and, arguably, more streamlined and elegant, manner. 
Because of its expressly claimed hinge member, the ’343 Patent claims 
require that the camera and support frame each be able to independently rotate 
about only a single axis of rotation.  See A0022 (district court explaining that 
“[t]he claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ object [i.e., the camera and 
support frame] as rotating about a single axis”).  But in the Accused Ball-and-
Socket Products, both the camera and support frame components can rotate about 
multiple axes with respect to each other.   The mere fact that the cameras can be 
both twisted and tilted about the socket ends the infringement inquiry because it 
establishes rotation of the camera about multiple distinct axes.  The Markman 
order conclusively established that such a configuration was outside the scope of 
the claims.   
Long before the district court’s Markman Order, however, the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products were facially non-infringing—the ball-and-socket joints are 
prominent and plainly visible, and their functionality is plain.  At the outset of this 
lawsuit no reasonable litigant could realistically have expected to avoid summary 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 35 of 242   Page ID #:35
 
14 
judgment.  Yet even after the Markman Order cemented AdjustaCam’s inability to 
prove infringement by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products, AdjustaCam pressed 
on.   
After the Markman Order, AdjustaCam served the expert report of John C. 
Muskivitch who—despite the district court’s clarification that “rotatably attached” 
objects are “limited to a single axis of rotation”—opined that the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products included a hinge member “adapted to be rotatably attached to 
the camera.”  See generally A1253-60.  By continuing to press its frivolous 
infringement arguments, and by forcing Newegg to retain a testifying expert to 
respond to such arguments, AdjustaCam’s bad faith is evident. Eltech Sys. Corp. v. 
PPG Indus., Inc., 903 F.2d 805, 811 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“Where, as here, the 
patentee is manifestly unreasonable in assessing infringement, while continuing to 
assert infringement in court, and inference is proper of bad faith.”). 
 
AdjustaCam’s only defense of its baseless case is a hollow contention that 
its infringement allegations are consistent with the district court’s constructions 
because “what Newegg/Rosewill allege is a ball and socket joint is actually a 
modified ball and socket joint . . . because there is a channel that restricts 
movement.”  A1194.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 36 of 242   Page ID #:36
 
15 
 
A1194-95.  According to AdjustaCam, “[t]his restricted movement results in two 
functionally independent joints which have ranges of movement independent of 
each other.”   Id.   In other words, AdjustaCam’s nonsensical position is that even 
though the camera can move in two different and distinct directions with respect to 
the support frame, the fact that a channel restricts that movement compared to a 
channel-less camera means that somehow the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products 
are “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  
 
The testimony of AdjustaCam’s expert highlights the absurdity of this 
contention.  In Dr. Muskovitch’s deposition, he explained that the various rotations 
are “separate” because “if I rotate it around to the center, there is nothing that 
forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”  A0482-83; A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”).  Even though the supposedly “constrained” ball-
and-socket joint is capable of moving in multiple directions, as long as one only 
chooses to move the joint in a single direction at a time, Dr. Muskovitch concluded 
that the joint is “limited to a single axis of rotation.”   
 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 37 of 242   Page ID #:37
 
16 
While the presence of two axes of rotation for the camera would be 
sufficient to preclude infringement, Dr. Muskovitch in fact conceded that there are 
at least three different axis of rotation for the camera in each Accused Ball-and-
Socket Product: “This happens to be a constrained ball and socket joint.  So it can 
[1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it may be able to [3] move to the 
side.”  A0485-87.   
Based on the foregoing, there could never have been any infringement by the 
Accused Ball-and-Socket Products.  AdjustaCam’s argument that a garden-variety 
ball-and-socket joint can somehow morph into, and be recharacterized as, two 
separate (single axis) joints is manifestly unreasonable. Even a “constrained ball-
and-socket joint,” as contrived by AdjustaCam, allows movement in multiple axes 
of rotation and is, therefore, outside the reach of the ’343 Patent’s claims. 
IV. 
AdjustaCam’s Validity Arguments 
 
 
Adjustacam also took frivolous positions in distinguishing prior art, such as 
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. H2-19997 to Irifune (“Irifune”). This prior 
art discloses a camera rotatably attached to a hinge member (mounting device (2)) 
via the threaded “camera attachment shaft (9)”: 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 38 of 242   Page ID #:38
 
17 
 
A1386, A1387, A1394.  AdjustaCam’s expert took the indefensible position that 
Irifune does not disclose a device that can be rotatably attached to a camera.  
Specifically, Dr. Muskivitch reasoned that “[w]ith Irifune, the camera is not even 
attached to the hinge member until fully tightened down using camera attachment 
shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and (11).” A1263.  Using an 
exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” (“permanently fixed joined, 
connected, or bound”), Dr. Muskivitch opined that Irifune did not meet the claim 
requirements because “[o]nce the camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera 
cannot rotate about a first axis relative to the hinge member.”  Id.   Put another 
way, in Dr. Muskivitch’s view, when the camera of Irifune is screwed all the way 
onto the hinge member, the camera cannot be rotated, and if the camera is loosened 
to permit rotation, the camera is not attached.  Id. (“[E]ven assuming for the sake 
of argument that with Irifune the camera is attached, it is not “rotatably attached.”). 
As early as August 12, 2011, in a reexamination proceeding regarding the 
’343 Patent, the USPTO rejected the asserted claims as anticipated and/or obvious 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 39 of 242   Page ID #:39
 
18 
based on Irifune.  A1425; A1431-36; A1376-96 (English translation of Irifune).  
Like Dr. Muskivitch later did in the litigation, during the reexamination 
proceedings patent owner Global-Media argued that the camera of Irifune is not 
“rotatably attached” to the hinge member because the camera “is not attached to 
the hinge member until fully screwed or threaded to the hinge member.” A1448.  
To make such an argument, Global-Media posited that the plain and ordinary 
meaning of attached is “permanently fixed, joined, connected, or bound.” A1447. 
The examiner rejected this argument twice, correctly concluding that “it is clearly 
possible to loosen the attachment screw, to enable the pivoting of the camera 
relative to support (fixed part 2) while the camera is still attached to the support.” 
A1508-10; A1476.  After the third rejection based on Irifune, Global-Media 
cancelled all the asserted claims on September 20, 2012.  A1515-19, A1460, 
A1465, A1469-74, A1493, A1502-06. 
V. AdjustaCam’s Nuisance-Value Settlements and Demands 
 
 
Newegg, like its co-defendants, was served with a lawsuit and then 
approached by AdjustaCam to discuss settlement of the case.  Nearly every 
defendant proceeded to settle for a dollar amount well under the cost to defend 
oneself against the infringement allegations, most for less than 
.  A1282 
(AdjustaCam settlement agreement summary). 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 40 of 242   Page ID #:40
 
19 
 
Just two months after filing this lawsuit in July 2010, AdjustaCam executed 
its first nuisance-value settlement with defendant Trippe Manufacturing in the 
amount of 
.  A2182.  Soon thereafter, AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Klip Extreme, LLC and Software Brokers of America (D/B/A 
Intcomex) for 
, and a few months later AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Phoebe Micro and jWIN for 
 and 
, respectively. 
Id.  By the time AdjustaCam dismissed Newegg in 2012, AdjustaCam had settled 
with at least:  
• Twelve defendants for 
 or less;  
• Three defendants for an amount between 
;  
• Five defendants for an amount between 
; and  
• Two defendants for an amount between 
.  
A1282.  All of the payments made by the various defendants are facially a small 
fraction of the cost of defense of a patent infringement lawsuit.   
 
None of the settlement payments have any demonstrable tie to the 
defendants’ potential exposure in the litigation.  Yet AdjustaCam and its damages 
expert maintained that AdjustaCam’s settlement agreements (and demands) were 
based on an established target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit. See A1195-97 (“In its 
licensing program for this litigation, AdjustaCam used this $1.25 - $1.50 per 
webcam royalty rate as a baseline for licensing the various defendants.”); A1324 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 41 of 242   Page ID #:41
 
20 
(“[T]he 14 lump-sum settlements were based on negotiations targeting a royalty of 
$1.25 to $1.50.”); A1327-30.  This assertion has no support in the record. For 
example, looking at the units sold by AdjustaCam’s licensees, the effective royalty 
rate for 15 of the lump-sum settlement ranged from a minimum of 
 to 
a maximum of 
, with scattered data points in between: 
A1283-85.  Of those 15 settlements, not a single agreement included an effective 
royalty rate between $1.25 and $1.50 per unit for the defendant’s known past sales 
figures.  Id.  Few were even close. 
The alleged basis for the target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit was two 
settlement and license agreements entered into in 20013 by one of AdjustaCam’s 
                                                 
3 The PAR Technologies agreements were therefore dated five years prior to the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case.  See A0540 (indicating that the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case was 2006). 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 42 of 242   Page ID #:42
 
21 
predecessors in interest, PAR Technologies, both of which included lump sum 
payments plus prospective running royalty components.  A1197; A1282; A1303-
06.  One of these agreements had a tiered prospective royalty structure ranging 
from 
 per unit as the number of units increased, and the other had 
a royalty structure of 
 per unit that decreased to 
 as the sales 
volume increased.  A0542-45; A0631.  From these two PAR Technologies 
agreements alone, to the exclusion of the more than a dozen other licenses that do 
not support the proffered royalty rage, and without making any comparison of the 
PAR Technologies licenses to the facts of the case against Newegg, AdjustaCam 
and its expert took the position that “a royalty in the $1.25 to $1.50 frame” was an 
appropriate and consistent target for licensing discussions.  A1305-06. 
Moreover, this supposed “target” royalty was essentially fixed in 
AdjustaCam’s view, as it was determined with no regard for price of the accused 
products sold by the defendants, the cost of the patented clip feature in the accused 
products, or even the number of units sold.  A1309-10 (characterizing $1.25 to 
$1.50 as the “intrinsic value of the patented feature” regardless of the sales price); 
A1311-12 (stating that the manufacturing cost of the patented camera clip is “not 
relevant” because “licensees have uniformly agreed to pay in the range of $1.25 to 
$1.50 per unit”); A1329-30 (explaining that a substantial increase in sales 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 43 of 242   Page ID #:43
 
22 
“wouldn’t affect my analysis because the target had always been in the range of 
$1.25 to $1.50”). 
AdjustaCam also tried to paint its target royalty as an established royalty.  
A1201 (“AdjustaCam’s settlement numbers were tied to a pre-established unit 
royalty of $1.25 - $1.50 per infringing device.”).  But AdjustaCam falls far short of 
the high standard for proving and established royalty because AdjustaCam did not 
show that the PAR Technologies licenses were of sufficient number and frequency 
“to establish a regular price for a license” and “reflect a general acquiescence in 
[the price’s] reasonableness,” that the royalty-establishing licenses were not 
settlements of threatened or actual litigation, and that the circumstances and rights 
of the licenses are comparable to those in the present lawsuit.  See, e.g., Rude v. 
Westcott, 130 U.S. 152, 165 (1889); Hanson v. Alpine Valley Ski Area, Inc., 718 
F.2d 1075, 1078 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  None of these factors are met in this case—the 
two PAR Technologies licenses were both settlements of litigation and neither was 
shown by AdjustaCam to be in any way comparable to the dispute between 
AdjustaCam and Newegg other than the fact that both involve the ’343 Patent.  
A1196; A0631. 
In attempt to manufacture some credibility for its “target royalty,” six of 
AdjustaCam’s litigation settlement agreements were drafted to include 
 once a certain threshold of 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 44 of 242   Page ID #:44
 
23 
sales was met beyond a fixed amount said to be covered by the lump-sum 
payment]].  A0545-49.  This self-serving provision was included by AdjustaCam 
knowing full well that none of those six defendants would sell enough products to 
ever pay a running royalty during the term of the patent.  A0558 (AdjustaCam’s 
expert stating “I understand that AdjustaCam utilized this royalty structure because 
these licensees had a low volume of past sales it would be highly unlikely that total 
volume sales would exceed the units included in the lump-sum payment”); A1313-
14 (AdjustaCam’s expert admitting that none of the six licensees ever reached the 
maximum number of sales and had to pay a running royalty).  Conveniently, 
AdjustaCam set the meaninglessly high number of units threshold, when divided 
by the lump sum payment, to equate to an effective royalty for past sales of 
.  A0631-33.  In reality, the parties to those six 
agreements, like every other settling defendant, paid nuisance value (between 
) to settle with AdjustaCam.  A631-33. 
Thus, all of AdjustaCam’s settlement licenses in reality reflect a nuisance-
value lump sum payment, and AdjustaCam has no evidence that it ever approached 
any negotiations with an intention to obtain its alleged target royalty.  Indeed, 
AdjustaCam’s 30(b)(6) representative could not even verify that it was, at any 
time, aware of the number of units sold by any of the defendants with which it 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 45 of 242   Page ID #:45
 
24 
settled.  A1337-38.  Such information certainly does not appear in AdjustaCam’s 
expert’s report.   
AdjustaCam also made multiple settlement offers to Newegg that reflect a 
nuisance value and were untied to Newegg’s sales of the accused cameras.  By the 
time of a November 9, 2011 mediation, Newegg had confirmed sales of 14,499 
units of the accused Rosewill products for total revenues of $63,760 and sales of 
5,904 units of other accused products—the majority of which were supplied to 
Newegg by other named defendants—for total revenues of $33,379.  A1784; 
A1226; A1362-63.  Despite claiming entitlement to a minimum per-unit royalty 
between $1.25 and $1.50, AdjustaCam demanded $75,000—nearly three times its 
“target” per-unit royalty and more than 75% of Newegg’s total revenue from sales 
of the accused products.  A1226; A1362-63. 
After mediation and before eventually dismissing Newegg, AdjustaCam 
made two additional nuisance-value settlement demands. In March 2012, after 
many of the accused Newegg products had been the subject of settlements between 
AdjustaCam and Newegg’s suppliers, AdjustaCam demanded $65,000 to settle the 
case. A1227.  Then, on July 11, 2012, less than two weeks after serving a report 
from its damages expert, AdjustaCam demanded more than $50,000 to settle.  
A1227; A1365.  This reduced demand was still nearly three times the amount 
calculated by AdjustaCam’s own expert.  A1244-45 (calculating damages as to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 46 of 242   Page ID #:46
 
25 
Newegg at $17,928—i.e., $1.25 x 14,342 units).  In fact, AdjustaCam’s expert 
admitted that this final demand, effectively more than $3.50 per unit, would be 
decidedly unreasonable.  A1331 (“Q. Do you believe a per-unit royalty for 
Newegg of $3 or more than $3 would be reasonable?  A. No.”) 
 
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 
 
AdjustaCam sued Newegg and its dozens of co-defendants solely for the 
improper purpose of seeking nuisance-value settlement payments.  This patent 
lawsuit had nothing to do with any bona fide complaint of infringement.  Newegg 
should not have to bear the burden and expense of such bad faith abuses of the 
patent system. 
Every agreement AdjustaCam obtained for its patent was for a dollar amount 
constituting a small fraction of the cost of defense, the majority for 
 or 
less, and always as a round number.  Yet AdjustaCam desperately twisted this 
nuisance-value evidence in attempt to justify an unsupportable $1.25 per unit 
royalty demand—a supposed “target royalty” that never really existed and was 
never used as a target by anybody in settlement discussions.  In truth, the 
defendants universally paid off AdjustaCam because it was far cheaper than 
defending themselves, just as AdjustaCam intended. 
Newegg refused to pay to make this case go away because AdjustaCam was 
abusively accusing products that did not, and could not, infringe the patent-in-suit, 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 47 of 242   Page ID #:47
 
26 
and was merely using the high cost of litigation defense for settlement leverage.  
For justice to be done, somebody had to challenge AdjustaCam’s baseless case and 
extortive business practices.  Newegg accepted the task. 
 
 AdjustaCam’s patent covers a camera that is claimed to rotate in a single 
axis of rotation.  But it is undisputed that AdjustaCam accused products having 
ball-and-socket joints such that, by definition, the cameras can be rotated about 
multiple axes of rotation.  This impossibility of infringement was apparent when 
the lawsuit was filed, but AdjustaCam pursued the case anyway because proving 
infringement was never the point of this lawsuit.   
 
Even after the district court construed the claims decisively foreclosing 
AdjustaCam’s effort to avoid the single-axis-of-rotation claim requirement, 
AdjustaCam pressed on undeterred as long as Newegg refused to accept 
AdjustaCam’s many nuisance-value settlement offers.  Clearly AdjustaCam 
assumed that eventually Newegg would take the easy way out and just pay to make 
this case go away, but AdjustaCam guessed wrong.  
 
Only after extensive and burdensome expert discovery solidified the long-
known and fatal shortcomings of AdjustaCam’s case, AdjustaCam simply walked 
away.  Finally conceding that its shakedown efforts against Newegg were futile 
and that its infringement case was doomed, AdjustaCam dismissed its case with 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 48 of 242   Page ID #:48
 
27 
prejudice, thus avoiding having to back up its allegations in court and put its patent 
in jeopardy.   
To make matters worse, all Newegg’s time and money (totaling more than 
$350,000 in attorneys’ fees and expert fees) was wasted on defending this frivolous 
lawsuit even though AdjustaCam knew for nearly a year before Newegg was 
dismissed that Newegg’s potential exposure was truly de minimis.  Newegg 
initially confirmed accused sales of less than $100,000, and that figure decreased 
over time as AdjustaCam’ licensed Newegg’s suppliers to a figure less than 
$20,000. 
Nuisance litigation like AdjustaCam’s cannot be encouraged, nor can it be 
immunized from fee-shifting merely because AdjustaCam eventually dismissed the 
case.  Although bad faith nuisance litigation is commonplace among today’s patent 
litigants, litigants are presumed to litigate in good faith.  Because AdjustaCam did 
not litigate in good faith, this case “stands out from the others” and is exceptional 
under Octane Fitness, and is also sufficiently egregious to warrant expert fee 
shifting.  This Court should declare as much and remand the case to determine the 
amount of Newegg’s recoverable fees.

28 
The denial of a motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.  Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 134 S. 
Ct. 1744, 1747 (2014) (“[A]n appellate court should review all aspects of a district 
court’s § 285 determination for abuse of discretion.”).   
A district court’s decision not to award expert fees under its inherent 
authority is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 
“The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate court’s 
correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: ‘A district court would 
necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the 
law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’”  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. 
at 1748 n. 2 (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990)). 
ARGUMENT 
 
I. The District Court Abused its Discretion by Not Finding This Case 
Exceptional and Egregious 
 
 
The Supreme Court in its recent Octane Fitness decision explained that, 
under 35 U.S.C. § 285, “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out from 
others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position 
(considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable 
manner in which the case was litigated.”  134 S. Ct. at 1756.  “District courts may 
determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-case exercise of their 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 50 of 242   Page ID #:50
 
29 
discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.”  Id.  For particularly 
egregious cases, district courts also have the inherent authority to award expert 
fees.  MarcTec v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(explaining that district courts should exercise this inherent authority in cases 
involving fraud or bad faith where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
As noted above, the district court decided Newegg’s motion before Octane 
Fitness relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285.  In 
denying Newegg’s motion, the district court recited and applied the then-applicable 
law under Brooks Furniture Mfg. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. 
Cir. 2005), stating that absent material inappropriate conduct in litigation, “an 
exceptional case may only be found if ‘both (1) the litigation is brought in 
subjective bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively baseless.’”  A0005. 
Unlike under the Brooks Furniture standard relied on by the district court, 
the exceptionality standard now does not, for example, require proof of both 
objective baselessness and bad faith, require misconduct to be independently 
sanctionable, or require proof by clear and convincing evidence.  Octane Fitness, 
134 S. Ct. at 1757-58.  Here, because the district court erred by denying Newegg’s 
motion under the strict Brooks Furniture standard, it certainly also erred under the 
far less burdensome Octane Fitness standard as well.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 51 of 242   Page ID #:51
 
30 
In denying Newegg’s motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, the district 
court misapprehended the evidence and the parties’ contentions to reach a 
manifestly incorrect result.  Under either the Brooks Furniture or Octane Fitness 
analytical framework, this “clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence” 
constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1748 n. 2. 
A. AdjustaCam Filed and Prosecuted This Case in Bad Faith 
 
According to the district court, “there is insufficient evidence that the action 
was brought in bad faith and for an improper purpose.”  A0006.  In fact, the 
evidence of bad faith was overwhelming. 
Not only did AdjustaCam pursue Newegg for two years on patent claims 
that were facially not infringed by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products, but it 
pressed on with its case even after the Markman Order emphatically precluded any 
possible relief for AdjustaCam.  See infra.  All the while, AdjustaCam made 
Newegg spend considerable sums of money on discovery—including extensive 
expert discovery—defending against these baseless allegations.  To make matters 
worse, all this time and money was wasted on a frivolous lawsuit even though 
AdjustaCam knew that Newegg’s potential exposure was minimal.  A1784; 
A1226; A1362-63. 
This bad faith behavior is easily understood when one looks at 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 52 of 242   Page ID #:52
 
31 
AdjustaCam’s purpose in bringing its lawsuits—to extract nuisance-value 
settlements.  Even the district court conceded that “the smaller settlements suggest 
this case was a settlement driven case.”  A0007.  The merits of the cases had 
nothing to do with the filing and maintenance of the lawsuits.  As long as 
AdjustaCam could convince its target defendants that it was cheaper, and made 
more business sense, to pay a small sum of money to make the case go away than 
to defend themselves, AdjustaCam would continue to collect its money without 
ever having to risk its patent and justify its positions in court.  But AdjustaCam did 
not count on Newegg defending itself, and had no choice but to dismiss Newegg if 
it wanted to preserve its shakedown business. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 53 of 242   Page ID #:53
 
32 
 
1. AdjustaCam Brought this Case for the Improper Purpose of 
Obtaining Nuisance-Value Settlements 
 
As explained above, the record shows that AdjustaCam’s settlement 
agreements are all for nuisance value.  See supra Statement of Facts, Part V.  The 
vast majority of Newegg’s co-defendants paid 
 or less to settle, more 
than half paying 
 or less, and always as a round number.  A1282. 
None of AdjustaCam’s post-hac efforts to align those nuisance-value 
agreements with its supposed damages calculations pass muster.  See supra 
Statement of Facts, Part V.  AdjustaCam’s fabrication of an unsupportable and 
unused “target” royalty (e.g., A1195-96), as well as its illusory and never-paid 
“running royalty” components of six of its settlements (A0545-49; A0558; A1313-
14; A0631-33), are no more than self-serving litigation-induced arguments.  In 
reality, the effective royalties paid by Newegg’s co-defendants were all over the 
map.  A1283-85 (effective royalties ranging from 
 per unit).  
Not even the two supposedly “foundational” PAR Technologies license 
agreements support a “target” (and, essentially, fixed) royalty of $1.25 to $1.50 per 
unit.  A0542-45 (discussing royalty ranges from 
); A0631. 
AdjustaCam’s settlements, as well as the settlement demands made to 
Newegg, are not reasonably tied to any prior comparable licenses or the potential 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 54 of 242   Page ID #:54
 
33 
infringement exposure of any party.  The settlement payments are merely round 
numbers set to encourage defendants not to fight the lawsuit on the merits due to 
the far greater expense involved in doing so.  District courts cannot turn a blind eye 
to such flagrant bad faith.   
As this Court has observed, “low settlement offers . . . effectively ensure[] 
that [the patentee’s] baseless infringement allegations remained unexposed, 
allowing [the patentee] to continue to collect additional nuisance value 
settlements.”  Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, 653 F.3d 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 
2011); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. York Int’l Corp., 244 F. Supp. 2d 990, 997 
(W.D. Wis. 2002) (Bad faith litigation tactics “force defendants into settlement and 
away from their legitimate defenses.”); Artese v. Academy Collection Service, No. 
3:96-cv-2546-GLG, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186, at *10 (D. Conn. Jan. 18, 2000) 
(holding that the filing of many lawsuits seeking relatively small settlements “gives 
rise to a suspicion of barratry and champerty”).   
Here, AdjustaCam’s settlement amounts are very small compared to the cost 
of defense, showing that AdjustaCam’s desire is to obtain settlement revenue 
rather than actually pursue its targeted defendants in litigation.  When Newegg, 
after nearly two years, still refused to pay to settle and remained determined to 
vindicate its positions in the litigation, AdjustaCam’s response exposed its true 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 55 of 242   Page ID #:55
 
34 
purpose in suing Newegg.  Instead of trying to prove Newegg’s defenses wrong in 
court, AdjustaCam simply walked away from its case.  Such an “overall vexatious 
litigation strategy” that is wasteful of judicial resources evidences bad faith.  See 
Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. v. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd., 726 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 
2013).    
Belated timing of dismissal can also evidence bad faith and justify fee 
shifting.  In Monolithic Power Systems, the case was deemed exceptional in large 
part because the plaintiff “withdrew its claims and granted covenants not to sue 
after substantial litigation had taken place,” “moving to dismiss only after 
[defendants] had completed their filings for the final pretrial conference, wasting 
the parties’ and the court’s resources.”  Id.  Likewise, here AdjustaCam waited two 
years to dismiss Newegg, knowing that Newegg’s exposure was minimal, and did 
not actually dismiss Newegg until after Newegg had incurred considerable expense 
in attorney and expert fees.  AdjustaCam cannot just lose interest and walk away 
with zero consequences after forcing Newegg to spend more than $350,000 in 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees to defend itself.  A1793-94 (explaining that Newegg 
expended $286,102.52 in attorneys’ fees, plus $68,183.93 in expert fees).   
In Ingenuity 13, LLC v. Doe, copyright plaintiffs were found to have acted in 
bad faith and sanctioned for fees in circumstances largely identical to those in this 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 56 of 242   Page ID #:56
 
35 
case.  No. 2:12-cv-8333-ODW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64564 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 
2013).  First, the plaintiffs engaged in a strategy to file lawsuits against many 
defendants.  Id. at *6-7.  Due to “the high cost of litigation,” “[m]ost defendants 
settled . . . , resulting in proceeds of millions of dollars due to the numerosity of 
defendants.”  Id.  “For defendants that refused to settle, the Principals engaged in 
vexatious litigation designed to coerce settlement. These lawsuits were filed using 
boilerplate complaints based on a modicum of evidence, calculated to maximize 
settlement profits by minimizing costs and effort.”  Importantly, like AdjustaCam, 
in Ingenuity 13 “[t]he Principals have shown little desire to proceed in these 
lawsuits when faced with a determined defendant.  Instead of litigating, they 
dismiss the case.”  Id. at *7.   
Courts have acknowledged in various circumstances that it is fundamentally 
unfair for a plaintiff to force a defendant to endure the substantial burden and 
expense of litigation and then lose interest and walk away from the case without 
any consequences.  See Colombrito v. Kelly, 764 F.2d 122, 134-35 (2d Cir. 1985) 
(noting that awarding fees would be appropriate “if a litigant had made a practice 
of repeatedly bringing potentially meritorious claims and then dismissing them 
with prejudice after inflicting substantial litigation costs on the opposing party and 
 the judicial system”); Upthegrove v. Health Prof’ls, LTD., No. 07-cv-0596-BBC, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4546, at *12 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 21, 2009) (“Plaintiff cannot 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 57 of 242   Page ID #:57
 
36 
expect to subject defendant Rose to a year of litigation and walk away with no 
consequences.”); compare Monolithic Power Sys., 726 F.3d at 1367 (affirming 
award of fees, emphasizing that vexatious case was dismissed “after substantial 
litigation had taken place . . . wasting the parties’ and the court’s resources”). 
AdjustaCam professes that its desire was not to extort a nuisance-value 
settlement from Newegg.  According to AdjustaCam, its decision to dismiss 
Newegg was for “strategic reasons unrelated to the merits”—essentially, 
“winnowing out” Newegg due to its de minimis infringement in comparison with 
Sakar once other defendants were dismissed and some of Newegg’s sales became 
licensed.  A1192-93.  First, the timing of events, with the Markman Order 
triggering several small settlements in short order, does not bear out AdjustaCam’s 
position.  See supra.  Second, AdjustaCam’s implying that it is perfectly acceptable 
to file and maintain lawsuits against “de minimis infringers” so long as it “winnows 
them out” and dismisses them before trial is deeply misguided.  Section 285’s 
exceptional case provision exists precisely to prevent such “gross injustice to an 
alleged infringer.” Mathis v. Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  
AdjustaCam knew of Newegg’s minimal exposure long before Newegg was 
dismissed and, in fact, well before Newegg had to endure the burden and expense 
of the February 2012 Markman hearing and subsequent discovery, including 
considerable expert discovery.  A1784; A1226; A1362-63 (describing sales figures 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 58 of 242   Page ID #:58
 
37 
provided to AdjustaCam at least as early as November 2011); A2136 (August 2012 
dismissal motion).  Shackling Newegg with considerable and unjustifiable 
litigation costs, despite Newegg’s minimal exposure, is exceptional and abusive.  
2. Nuisance Litigation is Exceptional and Egregious 
 
It is no secret that nuisance litigation brought by patent assertion entities is 
now fairly common and has become its own lucrative industry.  See, e.g., Colleen 
V. Chien, Patent Trolls by the Numbers, Santa Clara University Studies Research 
Paper No. 08-13, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2233041 (March 13, 2013) 
(explaining that patent assertion entities file the majority patent lawsuits in the 
U.S., primarily targeting non-technology companies). 
It would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this state of affairs that 
such litigation misconduct is not “exceptional” within the meaning of Section 285.  
Octane Fitness explained that “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out 
from others” regarding weak merits positions or litigation misconduct.  134 S. Ct. 
at 1756.  But the Court certainly did not suggest, let alone hold, that courts should 
allow themselves to become desensitized to bad faith nuisance litigation just 
because it is commonplace.   
Section 285 is supposed to be remedial—to correct for unfairness and 
injustice in a flexible, fact-specific manner.  See Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 59 of 242   Page ID #:59
 
38 
1753, 1756 n.6; see also Kilopass Tech., Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302,  
1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court was so cynical 
as to assume that patent litigation ordinarily involves bad faith and misconduct.  
The obvious assumption of Section 285 is that patent litigation will be brought and 
conducted in good faith, and that a case is “exceptional” when it sufficiently 
deviates from this expectation of litigants.  Cf. Medtronic Navigation, Inc. v. 
BrainLAB Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH, 603 F.3d 943, 954 (Fed. Cir. 
2010) (“[T]here is a presumption that an assertion of infringement of a duly 
granted patent is made in good faith.”). 
Moreover, using the court system to further AdjustaCam’s extortive business 
practices is the kind of egregious bad faith that warrants shifting of expert fees.  
MarcTec, 664 F.3d at 921.  Bad faith assertions of frivolous lawsuits unreasonably 
burden the litigation targets and the judicial system.  Awarding expert fees is 
especially appropriate where a plaintiff’s vexatious misconduct forces a defendant 
to incur those expert fees unnecessarily, as those fees are not compensable under 
Section 285.  Id. at 921-22 (holding that expert fees were properly awarded 
because “Cordis was forced to incur expert witness expenses to rebut MarcTec’s 
unreliable and irrelevant expert testimony,” such that “MarcTec’s vexatious 
conduct and bad faith increased  the cost of litigation in ways that are not 
compensated under § 285”).  Here, as in MarcTec, AdjustaCam’s experts’ 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 60 of 242   Page ID #:60
 
39 
testimony was fatally flawed and could not possibly have proven infringement or 
AdjustaCam’s alleged damages.  AdjustaCam only proceeded into expert 
discovery to apply more pressure to Newegg for a nuisance-value settlement.  For 
Newegg to have to spend $68,183.93 on experts to rebut AdjustaCam’s experts’ 
baseless allegations, on top of all the other misconduct and expense inflicted by 
AdjustaCam in seeking nuisance-value settlements, is a grave injustice that cannot 
be permitted.  Id. at 921 (inherent authority should be exercised to shift expert fees 
where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”). 
Patent litigation is supposed to resolve legitimate disputes surrounding bona 
fide infringement allegations, not facilitate nuisance-value patent monetization 
campaigns.  See Eon-Net, 653 F.3d at 1328 (“[T]he appetite for licensing revenue 
cannot overpower a litigant’s and its counsel’s obligation to file cases reasonably 
based in law and fact and to litigate those cases in good faith.”).  This Court should 
take this opportunity to clarify that litigation brought for the purposes of extorting 
nuisance-value settlements is exceptional will not be tolerated or immunized from 
fee-shifting simply because it is widespread.  And to the extent a nuisance 
litigation campaign cross into the expert discovery phase of a case, those expert 
expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
3. Nuisance Litigation Should be Discouraged 
 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 61 of 242   Page ID #:61
 
40 
Section 285 and Octane Fitness recognize that the specter of fee-shifting is 
intended to have a deterrent effect on bad faith litigation and misconduct.  134 S. 
Ct. at 1756 n.6 (reminding district courts of “the need in particular circumstances 
to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence”).  That purpose would 
be frustrated if all one had to do to avoid any possible fee-shifting is dismiss its 
case and avoid losing on the merits.  AdjustaCam cannot avoid the expensive and 
wasteful consequences of its extortion tactics simply because it dismissed Newegg 
from the case.  See Kilopass, 738 F.3d at 1317 (“[T]rial courts retain broad 
discretion to make findings of exceptionality under § 285 in a wide variety of 
circumstances.”).   
To be clear, a plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of a meritless case should be 
encouraged.  But when a case is brought for reasons unrelated to the merits and to 
obtain nuisance-value settlements, as it was here, the incentive to dismiss must also 
include an incentive to dismiss at a meaningful time—i.e., before substantial 
expense and burden is inflicted on the defendant.  This Court should clarify that 
Section 285 provides those incentives, and that such plaintiffs who pursue their 
cases for too long before dismissing will be viewed as acting in bad faith and will 
be ordered to pay a defendant’s attorney’s fees.  And again, to the extent a 
nuisance litigation campaign cross into the expert discovery phase of a case, those 
expert expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 62 of 242   Page ID #:62
 
41 
 
Using the United States judiciary to leverage nuisance-value settlements also 
reflects selfish opportunism and unreasonably burdens the courts.  See Artese, 2000 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 at *10-11 (“[I]t is not merely the prejudice and costs to the 
opposing party but also the effect upon the judicial system of such litigation. When 
we consider the numerous other cases commenced by this plaintiff . . . there has 
been indeed a substantial burden on the judicial system.”).  Behavior that treats the 
judiciary as a pawn for nuisance-value settlement negotiations and makes courts 
waste considerable time and resources should be strongly discouraged.   
By contrast, defendants like Newegg, who do not pay a patentee in a 
nuisance litigation simply to make a lawsuit go away, play an important role in the 
patent system.  Such defendants insist that plaintiffs justify their positions and, 
when the plaintiffs cannot or will not do so, will vindicate their defenses in court.  
But for defendants like Newegg, abusive nuisance litigants would never be 
exposed because every case would settle and conceal the misconduct.  Given the 
remedial nature of Section 285, Newegg and other similarly-situated defendants 
should not be discouraged from taking this more onerous and expensive course, 
helping to ensure that the patent system is not abused. 
Absent a meaningful fee-shifting standard where fees are reasonably 
attainable, defendants are more likely to simply settle nuisance litigations because 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 63 of 242   Page ID #:63
 
42 
the financial downsides are overwhelming.  If AdjustaCam’s conduct is not 
deemed exceptional and egregious in this case, it will embolden nuisance litigants 
to continue their abusive conduct unchecked.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 64 of 242   Page ID #:64
 
43 
 
B. The Accused Cameras Could Not Possibly Have Infringed 
 
The district court agreed with AdjustaCam that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included constrained ball-and-socket joints that restricted movement to 
some extent.  A0006. According to the district court, this constricted movement 
made it possible for AdjustaCam to prevail in proving infringement: 
[i]f the ball and socket joint truly restricts the range of movement 
such that it cannot rotate about multiple axes, the constrained ball and 
socket joint could meet the claim limitation which requires the hinge 
member being rotatably attached to the camera in a single axis of 
rotation.  Since one could reasonably argue Defendants’ products 
meet the “rotatably attached” limitation, AdjustaCam’s infringement 
theories are not objectively baseless. 
A0006.  The problem is that the above-emphasized portion—the premise and sine 
qua non of the district court’s conclusion—is not true and does not even reflect 
AdjustaCam’s position.  It is undisputed that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included cameras that were in fact capable of rotating about multiple axes 
with respect to the socket—they could be both twisted and tilted up and down. 
AdjustaCam never argued that the constrained ball-and-socket joints were 
incapable of rotating about multiple axes—it merely posited that the different 
rotations were “separate.”  A0482-83 (“[I]f I rotate it around to the center, there is 
nothing that forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”); A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”); A0485-87 (“This happens to be a constrained 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 65 of 242   Page ID #:65
 
44 
ball and socket joint.  So it can [1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it 
may be able to [3] move to the side.”).  
On this record, there is no question that the cameras of the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products were capable of rotating in at least two different and distinct 
directions with respect to the sockets, not merely rotating about the claimed and 
singular “first axis of rotation.”  ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“said camera, when the 
hinge member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said 
hinge member”).  It was objectively baseless for AdjustaCam to contend that such 
cameras were “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  One could not 
reasonably argue otherwise. 
Importantly, AdjustaCam was not advancing a theory of infringement under 
the doctrine of equivalents, and so its case hinged on proof of literal infringement. 
See, e.g., A0996-97 and A1160-61 (AdjustaCam’s expert report presenting only 
direct, literal infringement theory). 
Long before the district court’s Markman Order formally doomed 
AdjustaCam’s case, the plain language of the claims, and especially in light of the 
specification, made clear that the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products could not 
possibly infringe.  A0022 (“The claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ 
object as rotating about a single axis.”); A0021 (“Every reference to a ‘rotatably 
attached’ object in the specification and claims describes the attachment as 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 66 of 242   Page ID #:66
 
45 
permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).  From the outset of this lawsuit, 
no reasonable plaintiff could have expected to succeed in proving infringement. 
The situation would be somewhat different if AdjustaCam honestly did not 
know that infringement was impossible to prove at the outset of the case, but later 
discovered that it could not prevail.  Here, such ignorance is implausible given the 
readily apparent functionality of the accused products and the simplicity of the 
patent and its claims.  But even if AdjustaCam could legitimately plead ignorance, 
ignorance is no excuse to continue undeterred—for nearly five months, which 
included considerable and expensive expert discovery—after the district court’s 
decisive Markman ruling in Newegg’s favor.  A0013-27 (April 10, 2012 Markman 
Order); A2141 (August 27, 2012 motion to dismiss Newegg).  Here, as in 
MarcTec, AdjustaCam “not only initiated a frivolous lawsuit, it persisted in 
advancing unfounded arguments that unnecessarily extended this litigation and 
caused [defendant] to incur needleless litigation expenses. This vexatious conduct 
is, by definition, litigation misconduct, and provides a separate and independent 
basis supporting the district court’s determination that this case is exceptional.”  
MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, at 920-21 (Fed. Cir. 2012).    
C. AdjustaCam’s Validity Positions Were Frivolous 
 
As explained above, AdjustaCam advanced the following frivolous 
argument in response to the clear anticipation of its claims by Irifune: “With 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 67 of 242   Page ID #:67
 
46 
Irifune, the camera is not even attached to the hinge member until fully tightened 
down using camera attachment shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and 
(11).” A1263.  Using the exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” offered in 
the reexamination, AdjustaCam’s expert Dr. Muskivitch opined that, “[o]nce the 
camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera cannot rotate about a first axis 
relative to the hinge member.”  Id. 
These concocted arguments were objectively baseless for several reasons.  
First, AdjustaCam’s illogical attempt to narrow the meaning of “rotatably 
attached” contradicts the claim language and the specification of the ’343 Patent.  
If the camera disclosed in the ’343 Patent was “permanently fixed to,” or had to be 
fully tightened down to the hinge member, then the camera could not rotate about 
the first axis of rotation as the claims and specification require.  Indeed, such 
arguments contradict AdjustaCam’s own proposed construction of “rotatably 
attached” in this litigation (“connected such that the connected object is capable of 
being rotated”).  A2813-14.  The Irifune camera is certainly “capable of being 
rotated”—e.g., when it is partially unscrewed from the threaded camera attachment 
shaft on the hinge.  AdjustaCam’s argument that a camera is not rotatably attached 
to a hinge member unless it is “permanently fixed to” or fully tightened down to 
the hinge member also contradicts the district court’s Markman Order because 
such a camera would not be capable of rotation about any axis.  A0021 (“Every 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 68 of 242   Page ID #:68
 
47 
reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object in the specification and claims describes 
the attachment as permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).   AdjustaCam 
could not reasonably expect to prevail against Newegg’s invalidity arguments 
based on Irifune. 
II. AdjustaCam’s Appeal Must be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction 
 
Consistent with AdjustaCam’s bad faith overreaching and indifference to the 
merits of this litigation, AdjustaCam brought its own affirmative appeal to this 
Court where subject matter jurisdiction is indisputably lacking.  There is no legal 
support whatsoever for AdjustaCam’s attempt to appeal a claim construction issue 
that it lost in the district court, made no effort to preserve for appeal, and expressly 
extinguished when it dismissed its case against Newegg with prejudice. This 
frivolous appeal only compounds the exceptionality of this case and causes 
Newegg to incur further needless legal expenses. 
An “actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at 
the time the complaint was filed.”  Benitec Austl, Ltd. v. Nucleonics, Inc., 495 F.3d 
1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 
(1974)).  “Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold requirement for a court’s power 
to exercise jurisdiction over a case, and no amount of ‘prudential reasons’ or 
perceived increases in efficiency, however sound, can empower a federal court to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 69 of 242   Page ID #:69
 
48 
hear a case where there is no extant case or controversy.”  Dow Jones & Co., Inc. 
v. Ablaise Ltd., 606 F.3d 1338, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
AdjustaCam filed its notice of appeal seeking review of the district court’s 
claim construction rulings.  A0193.  But by that time, Newegg had already been 
dismissed with prejudice from the case and given a covenant not to be sued in the 
future for infringement of the ’343 Patent.  A2136-37; A1986-87; A0155.  The 
dismissal and covenant extinguished any ongoing disputes between AdjustaCam 
and Newegg concerning the infringement and validity of the ’343 Patent.  Indeed, 
when dismissing Newegg AdjustaCam even argued that its covenant divested the 
district court of subject matter jurisdiction over Newegg’s declaratory judgment 
counterclaims, citing Dow Jones, 606 F.3d at 1348 and Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. 
Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  A2136-37.  If there 
is no jurisdiction over Newegg’s non-infringement and invalidity counterclaims 
due to a lack of an ongoing controversy, certainly there can be no jurisdiction over 
AdjustaCam’s underlying infringement claims that were dismissed with prejudice. 
This Court has often recognized its inability to reach claim construction 
issues that are not subject to an ongoing case or controversy. See, e.g, SanDisk 
Corp. v. Kingston Tech. Co., 695 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[W]here, as 
here, a party’s claim construction arguments do not affect the final judgment 
entered by the court, they are not reviewable. . . . Without a final judgment as to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 70 of 242   Page ID #:70
 
49 
the infringement or validity of these claims, the court’s claim constructions that 
impact only these withdrawn claims are not properly before us.”); Jang v. Boston 
Sci. Corp., 532 F.3d 1330, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (resolving claim construction 
issues “that do not actually affect the infringement controversy between the 
parties” would result in impermissible advisory opinion because “[t]he Supreme 
Court has explicitly held that Article III does not permit the courts to resolve issues 
when it is not clear that the resolution of the question will resolve a concrete 
controversy between interested parties”); see also NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, 
Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 
Although AdjustaCam purports to appeal from the district court’s final 
judgment, because that final judgment was in no way based on the claim 
construction ruling, but was instead based entirely on the mutual consent of the 
parties to end the case, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the 
claim constructions.   
This is not a case where the parties consented to a judgment of non-
infringement based on the claim constructions to allow for appeal of the 
construction.  See, e.g., SanDisk, 695 F.3d at 1353 (“SanDisk voluntarily withdrew 
the ’893 and ’808 patents and claims 1 and 10 of the ’842 patent from this action, 
and it does not dispute that the district court never entered a stipulated judgment of 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 71 of 242   Page ID #:71
 
50 
non-infringement with respect to these claims. Thus, these claims do not present a 
current infringement controversy before this court.”). 
Here, AdjustaCam made no effort whatsoever to preserve any challenges to 
the district court’s claim constructions when it decided to dismiss its case against 
Newegg.  Even in defending AdjustaCam’s litigation positions and opposing 
Newegg’s motion for attorneys’ fees, AdjustaCam noted no disagreement with the 
district court’s claim constructions.  A1191-94; A1194 (arguing that 
“AdjustaCam’s infringement positions are entirely consistent with the Court’s 
construction”). 
This Court cannot hear AdjustaCam’s appeal because it lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction over the challenges raised to the claim construction rulings by the 
district court.  AdjustaCam’s appeal must be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be 
reversed, this case should be declared exceptional and egregious, and the case 
should be remanded for a determination of the amount of attorneys’ fees and expert 
fees owed to Newegg.   
 
Additionally, AdjustaCam’s appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT 
 
Sakar’s Cross-Appeal: 
The district court had original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1338(a).  Sakar filed a timely and proper notice of appeal under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4.  This Court has appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 
AdjustaCam’s Appeal: 
For reasons discussed below, this Court does not have subject matter 
jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s appeal and AdjustaCam’s appeal must be 
dismissed. 
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES 
 
 
1. 
Whether the district court erred by failing to find this case exceptional 
and egregious under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and its inherent authority to award Sakar its 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, despite clear and unrebutted evidence showing that 
this lawsuit was meritless, was prosecuted in bad faith, and was prosecuted to 
leverage the high cost and burden of litigation to coerce a nuisance-value 
settlement payment from Sakar. 
 
2. 
Whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s 
appeal, given that the case on the merits was mutually and voluntarily dismissed in 
its entirety, and no case or controversy remains between the parties.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
AdjustaCam, LLC (“AdjustaCam”) brought this action in July 2010 against 
59 defendants, including Defendant Sakar, alleging that certain camera products 
sold by Sakar infringed United States Patent No. 5,885,343 (“the ’343 Patent”), 
entitled “Camera Clip.”  A0004.  The ’343 Patent is owned by Global-Media 
Group, LLC and AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of the patent.  A1789. 
After filing suit AdjustaCam began seeking to settle with the defendants for 
amounts far below the cost of defense.  All defendants other than Defendant Sakar 
and Newegg Inc., Newegg.com, Inc., and Rosewill, Inc. (collectively, “Newegg” 
or “the Newegg Defendants”) settled with AdjustaCam well before trial and were 
dismissed.  A0004.  However, 20 out of 22 defendants settled for less than 
.  A1282. 
During the reexamination, on August 12, 2011, the USPTO issued a first 
Office Action and rejected the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent, as being 
anticipated and/or obvious based on Japanese Utility Model Publication No. H2-
19997 to Irifune (the “Irifune Publication”) and U.S. Patent No. 5,880,783 to Ma 
entitled “Digital Camera for a Computer” (the “Ma Patent”).  
Then a Markman hearing was held on February 9, 2012 to construe various 
claim terms of the ’343 Patent.  A0013.  Magistrate Judge Love issued a Markman

order on April 10, 2012, which was subsequently adopted in full by Chief Judge 
Davis on June 7, 2012.  A0013-27; A0012 (“the Markman Order”).   
Among the terms addressed in the Markman Order was the term “[r]otatably 
attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach.” A0020-
23.  The parties disputed whether the term as used in the claims “allow[s] for a 
‘rotatably attached’ object to rotate over more than a single axis.”  A0020.  The 
district court agreed with the defendants, noting that “[t]he claims plainly describe 
each ‘rotatably attached’ object as rotating about a single axis.”  A0022.1  The 
district court also explained that “[e]very reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object 
in the specification and claims describes the attachment as permitting motion over 
a single axis of rotation.”  A0021.  Although the term “did not require 
construction,” the district court nonetheless resolved the claim interpretation 
dispute, holding that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are limited 
to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23 (prohibiting the parties from contradicting 
the district court’s resolution of the dispute as the case went forward). 
                                                 
1 As the district court explained (A0020), the claims of the ’343 Patent referred 
consistently to a “rotatably attached” hinge member rotating in only one of two 
specific axes of rotation, depending on whether it was rotating with respect to the 
camera or the support frame.  See, e.g., Claim 1 (“a hinge member adapted to be 
rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge member is so 
attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge member”); 
(“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . said hinge member 
rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support frame, said first axis 
of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis of rotation”).

Since Sakar’s accused products had essentially a ball and socket joint, it was 
clear that Sakar accused products had multiple axes of rotation, and not just one or 
two axes of rotation, as required by the ’343 Patent claims.  Therefore, it was clear 
that there was no infringement for a camera having a multi-axis ball and socket 
joint. 
Nevertheless AdjustaCam continued to settle with 20 out of 22 defendants 
for less than 
. At the same time, 
AdjustaCam’s counsel was also delaying and prolonging the reexamination of the 
’343 Patent for one year until August 30, 2012 when the USPTO finally rejected 
the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent during a third Office Action as being not 
patentable and therefore invalid.  This was more than 2 years into the case, and 
most of the defendants had already settled except for Sakar, and the Newegg 
Defendants. Then, on September 20, 2012, after most of the defendants had settled, 
AdjustaCam’s counsel finally responded to the USPTO by cancelling the asserted 
claims from the ’343 Patent. AdjustaCam could have cancelled the asserted claims 
of the ’343 Patent (or at least withdrawn them from this litigation) long before 
September 20. Instead, AdjustaCam acted in bad faith by asserting frivolous 
responses to the USPTO’s first two rejections between August 12, 2011 and 
August 30, 2012, in order to buy additional time to enter into additional nuisance-
value settlements.

On August 27, 2012, after considerable expert discovery was completed and 
the case was on the verge of summary judgment and Daubert proceedings, 
AdjustaCam filed a motion to dismiss its claims against the Newegg Defendants 
with prejudice.  A2136-37.  The motion also sought to dismiss the Newegg 
Defendants’ invalidity and non-infringement declaratory judgment counterclaims 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, with prejudice, based on a covenant not to 
sue that extinguished the case or controversy with respect to the counterclaims.  Id.  
According to AdjustaCam, the reason for its motion was that it had “recently 
resolved its claims against almost all of the remaining Defendants,” including 
defendants whose products were sold by Newegg, such that “NewEgg/Rosewill is 
no longer selling unlicensed webcams manufactured by any other Defendant.”  
A2137.  Thus, AdjustaCam professed a “desire[] to simplify this case by focusing 
its claims going forward solely upon Defendant Sakar and Defendant Kohl’s, 
which is accused of infringement solely on account of Sakar manufactured 
products.  NewEgg/Rosewill’s remaining damages exposure . . . is relatively de 
minimis, and is dwarfed by the damages exposure of Sakar.”  A2137-38. 
After AdjustaCam dismissed both the asserted claims and Sakar from the 
case, Sakar filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees 
, 
which was denied by the trial court.  A0156, A0160.

7 
 
  On Sept. 18, 2013, Sakar then filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the 
denial of its motion for attorneys’ fees. Although AdjustaCam’s notice of appeal 
also referred to the district court’s final judgment, that final judgment was not 
premised on any claim construction issues, nor did AdjustaCam seek a consent 
judgment incorporating the claim construction order as the basis for a judgment of 
non-infringement.  Rather, the final judgment merely reflected the parties’ agreed 
mutual dismissal of the case.  A0001-03; A1986-87. 
Meanwhile, after Newegg had withdrawn its motion to correct the judgment, 
and shortly before this appeal was reactivated, the Supreme Court decided Octane 
Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 (2014), which 
relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Unable to squeeze a 
 settlement payment from Sakar after 
more than two years of litigation, since all of the defendants had settled except for 
Sakar and the Newegg Defendants, AdjustaCam decided to dismiss Sakar with 
prejudice in order to end the case.   
The filing and prosecution of this action by AdjustaCam was intended to 
extort nuisance-value settlement fees from defendants, and not to resolve any 
legitimate claims of infringement or damages.  In fact, AdjustaCam knew at the 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 13     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 88 of 242   Page ID #:88

time of the first Office Action rejection of the claims on August 12, 2011, that 
AdjustaCam could not prevail. Yet, AdjustaCam did not withdraw the patent 
claims and continued with the prosecution of its infringement claims and with the 
settlements. Such a baseless case that abuses the judiciary for personal gain is 
exceptional and warrants fee shifting. 
By the time Sakar filed its motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, 
AdjustaCam had forced Sakar to spend a total of 
, including 
 in 
attorney’s fees and 
 in expert witness fees to defend itself.  A1793-94.  
Sakar contends that it should not have to bear these fees, and that Sakar should be 
reimbursed by AdjustaCam  
II. The Parties 
AdjustaCam is a limited liability company that is exclusively in the business 
of patent litigation.  As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acacia Research Group, 
LLC, its business follows the all-too-familiar model of using the burden and 
expense of patent litigation as leverage to extort settlement fees from defendants.  
A1779. 
Sakar is a wholesaler of consumer electronics products and accessories that 
it sells to various retailers throughout the United States under the brand name 
VIVITAR®.  Sakar does not manufacture its products, including the accused 
webcam products in this case, but simply purchases its products from third parties

in China and then resells them in the United States.  Sakar’s accused webcam 
products in this case were sold under Sakar’s licensed brand name “Kodak.”  
A large number of AdjustaCam’s target defendants in this case were 
successful online retailers like Amazon.com and Newegg, who simply purchased 
and re-sold the accused cameras, not manufacturers who actually made the accused 
cameras. 
III. 
AdjustaCam’s Infringement Allegations 
 
AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of United States Patent No. 5,855,343 
(“the ’343 Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”   A1789.   The ’343 Patent is generally 
directed to a camera clip that supports a camera when sitting on a flat surface or 
when attached to an object, such as a computer monitor: 
 
                                
 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 15     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 90 of 242   Page ID #:90
10 
 
 
’343 Patent, Figs. 1, 2, 4.  The clip allows the camera to rotate in two distinct 
directions about distinct axes of rotation. 
First, as shown in Fig. 1, the camera can be rotated to pan side-to-side.  The 
specification explains: “[h]inge member 16 is rotatably attached to camera 12, 
where camera 12 rotates over a first axis 26 in a direction shown by arrow 28 
relative to hinge member 16.”  ’343 Patent, at 4:17-19.  Second, as shown in Fig. 2, 
the camera can be tilted upward and downward.  The specification explains: 
“[h]inge member 16 rotates over a second axis 32 in the direction shown by arrow 
34 relative to support frame 18.  First axis 26 is perpendicular to second axis 32.”  
 ’343 Patent, at 4:21-24. 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 16     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 91 of 242   Page ID #:91
11 
 
 
These particular two axes of rotation are expressly required by all 
independent claims in the ’343 Patent.  See, e.g., ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“a hinge 
member adapted to be rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the 
hinge member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said 
hinge member”); id (“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . , 
said hinge member rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support 
frame, said first axis of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis 
of rotation”).2   
To be clear, the camera products claimed in the ’343 Patent require three 
distinct components of importance to this case: (1) a camera; (2) a hinge member; 
and (3) a support frame. While the camera product—including the hinge 
member—rotates about two axes, the camera of the ’343 Patent itself only rotates 
about one axis; this is what is described, and this is what is claimed. This is evident 
from the claim language, which specifies that the camera is “rotatably attached” to 
the hinge member of the claimed apparatus such that the camera rotates about a 
single axis of rotation (the claimed “first axis of rotation”).  Similarily, the 
support frame of the apparatus is itself “rotatably attached” to the hinge member 
such that the support frame rotates relative to the hinge member about a separate, 
single axis of rotation (the claimed “second axis of rotation”). Importantly, the

two axes of rotation with respect to the three components are distinct, and are 
distinctly claimed.  Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the term 
“[r]otatably attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably 
attach” as used in the claims indicated that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the 
patent-in-suit are limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  
Unlike the camera covered by the ’343 Patent, AdjustaCam accused 
products do not rotate about a single axis of rotation. Instead, Sakar’s products (the 
“Accused Ball-and-Socket Products”) include a camera connected to a support 
frame via a ball-and-socket joint, which facilitates rotation about multiple axes, 
not just a first and second axis of rotation, as claimed. 
This constitutes substantial and material differences between the Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Camera Product of Sakar and the ’343 Patent claims, as illustrated 
by the following photographs of the accused Kodak webcams (Model Nos. Kodak 
S101 and Kodak T130): 
 
 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 18     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 93 of 242   Page ID #:93
13 
 
A0307.  The nature of these ball-and-socket joints is that they allow for rotation for 
each of the parts of the camera product about multiple axes—the camera is able to 
spin and pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to the socket (not just 
a single axis), and the support frame is likewise able to spin and pivot about 
multiple axes of rotation with respect to the ball (not just a single axis). A0296-
98.  Comparing the accused products to the claims and specification of the ’343 
Patent shows that AdjustaCam’s infringement allegations were baseless.   
Another key reason the ’343 Patent claims do not read on the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products is the fact that, unlike the three distinct components claimed 
in the ’343 Patent, Sakar’s accused Ball-and-Socket Product has only two distinct 
components of importance to this case: (1) a camera; and (2) a support frame.  The 
use of a ball-and-socket joint between these two components eliminates the need 
for a third element—an intermediate hinge member—as claimed in the ’343 
Patent.  A ball-and-socket camera is simply not an infringing product to accuse 
of infringement given the precisely claimed three-part camera of the ’343 Patent 
and its limited rotation capabilities.  Sakar’s Accused Ball-and-Socket Product 
works in a fundamentally different and, arguably, more streamlined and elegant 
manner. Also, the Markman order conclusively established that such a 
configuration was outside the scope of the claims.   
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 19     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 94 of 242   Page ID #:94
14 
 
Because of its expressly claimed hinge member, the ’343 Patent claims 
require that the camera and support frame each be able to independently rotate 
about only a single axis of rotation.  See A0022 (district court explaining that 
“[t]he claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ object [i.e., the camera and 
support frame] as rotating about a single axis”).  But in the Accused Ball-and-
Socket Products, both the camera and support frame components can rotate about 
multiple axes with respect to each other.   The mere fact that the cameras can be 
both twisted and tilted about the socket ends the infringement inquiry because it 
establishes rotation of the camera about multiple distinct axes.   
Long before the district court’s Markman Order, however, Sakar’s Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products were facially non-infringing—the ball-and-socket joints 
are prominent and plainly visible, and their functionality is plain.  At the outset of 
this lawsuit no reasonable litigant could realistically have expected to avoid 
summary judgment.  Yet even after the first Office Action rejection and the 
Markman Order cemented AdjustaCam’s inability to prove infringement by 
Sakar’s Accused Ball-and-Socket Product, AdjustaCam pressed on with the case in 
bad faith, and continued to extract settlements, including attempts to settle with 
Sakar.   
At the deposition of Muskovitch (Adjustacam’s patent expert) on August 24, 
2012, he admitted that Sakar’s camera did not infringe. (See the three admissions 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 20     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 95 of 242   Page ID #:95
15 
 
below by Muskovitch.) Therefore, AdjustaCam’s bad faith is evident. Eltech Sys. 
Corp. v. PPG Indus., Inc., 903 F.2d 805, 811 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“Where, as here, the 
patentee is manifestly unreasonable in assessing infringement, while continuing to 
assert infringement in court, an inference is proper of bad faith.”). 
 
AdjustaCam’s only defense of its baseless case is a hollow contention that 
its infringement allegations are consistent with the district court’s constructions 
because “[w]hat Sakar alleges is a ‘ball and socket joint’ is actually a modified 
joint with a socket and no ball…because there is a channel that restricts 
movement.”  A0262.   
 
 
A0262-63.  According to AdjustaCam, “[t]his restricted movement results in two 
functionally independent joints which have ranges of movement independent of 
each other.”   Id.   In other words, AdjustaCam’s nonsensical position is that even 
though the camera can move in two different and distinct directions with respect to 
the support frame, the fact that a channel restricts that movement compared to a 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 21     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 96 of 242   Page ID #:96
16 
 
channel-less camera means that somehow the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products 
are “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23. Such frivolous arguments 
amount to bad faith. 
 
The testimony of AdjustaCam’s expert highlights the absurdity of this 
contention.  In Dr. Muskovitch’s deposition, he explained that the various rotations 
are “separate” because “if I rotate it around to the center, there is nothing that 
forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”  A0482-83; A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”).  Even though the supposedly “constrained” ball-
and-socket joint is capable of moving in multiple directions, as long as one only 
chooses to move the joint in a single direction at a time, Dr. Muskovitch concluded 
that the joint is “limited to a single axis of rotation.”   
 
While the presence of two axes of rotation for the camera would be 
sufficient to preclude infringement, Dr. Muskovitch in fact conceded that there are 
at least three different axis of rotation for cameras such as Sakar’s Accused Ball-
and-Socket Product: “This happens to be a constrained ball and socket joint.  So it 
can [1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it may be able to [3] move to 
the side.”  A0485-87.  Significantly, Dr. Muskivitch, admitted three times during 
his deposition on cross-examination that Sakar’s Kodak webcams with a ball and 
stem fixed to the camera DO NOT rotate about a single axis of rotation as required 
by asserted claims 1(a) and 19(a):

17 
 
   
1) First Admission 
 
A. Yes. The stem and the ball and the camera all are -- if you are  
 
 
going to rotate it, they will all rotate together. 
 
Q. Okay. So am I correct, would you be -- is it correct to say that the  
 
 
Kodak camera does not rotate relative to the stem and ball because  
 
 
they are fixed to each other? 
 
A. That’s correct. (Muskivitch Deposition, p.280, ll.4-12); 
 
2) Second Admission 
 
Q. Well, we have -- we have already talked about the relationship  
 
 
between the camera and the stem and ball, and we have agreed earlier  
 
 
-- or you agreed earlier that -- that in a Kodak webcam, there is no  
 
 
rotational movement between the -- the camera and the ball and stem  
 
 
that fits [are  fixed] together. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yeah, sure, sure. (Id. at 308, ll.12-19); and 
 
3) Third Admission 
 
Q. Okay. But there is no relative movement between the ball and  
 
 
stem, which are -- and the camera, which are fixed together,  
 
 
 
correct? 
 
A. I agree. Right. (Id. at 311, ll.14-17).   
 
(A0297-98). 
 
Based on the foregoing admissions by AdjustaCam’s expert, there could 
never have been any infringement by Sakar’s Accused Ball-and-Socket Product.  
AdjustaCam’s argument that a garden-variety ball-and-socket joint can somehow 
morph into, and be recharacterized as, two separate (single axis) joints is 
manifestly unreasonable. Even a “constrained ball-and-socket joint,” as contrived 
by AdjustaCam, allows movement in multiple axes of rotation and is, therefore, 
outside the reach of the ’343 Patent’s claims.

IV. 
AdjustaCam’s Validity Arguments 
 
 
Adjustacam also took frivolous positions in distinguishing the prior art cited 
by the Examiner, such as Japanese Utility Model Publication No. H2-19997 to 
Irifune (“Irifune”). This prior art discloses a camera rotatably attached to a hinge 
member (mounting device (2)) via the threaded “camera attachment shaft (9)”: 
 
A1386, A1387, A1394.  AdjustaCam’s expert took the indefensible position that 
Irifune does not disclose a device that can be rotatably attached to a camera.  
Specifically, Dr. Muskivitch reasoned that “[w]ith Irifune, the camera is not even 
attached to the hinge member until fully tightened down using camera attachment 
shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and (11).” A1263.  Using an 
exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” (“permanently fixed joined, 
connected, or bound”), Dr. Muskivitch opined that Irifune did not meet the claim 
requirements because “[o]nce the camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera 
cannot rotate about a first axis relative to the hinge member.”  Id.   Put another 
way, in Dr. Muskivitch’s view, when the camera of Irifune is screwed all the way 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 24     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 99 of 242   Page ID #:99
19 
 
onto the hinge member, the camera cannot be rotated, and if the camera is loosened 
to permit rotation, the camera is not attached.  Id. (“[E]ven assuming for the sake 
of argument that with Irifune the camera is attached, it is not “rotatably attached.”). 
As early as August 12, 2011, in a reexamination proceeding regarding the 
’343 Patent, the USPTO rejected the asserted claims as anticipated and/or 
obvious based on Irifune.  A1425; A1431-36; A1376-96 (English translation of 
Irifune).  Like Dr. Muskivitch later did in the litigation, during the reexamination 
proceedings patent owner Global-Media argued that the camera of Irifune is not 
“rotatably attached” to the hinge member because the camera “is not attached to 
the hinge member until fully screwed or threaded to the hinge member.” A1448.  
To make such an argument, Global-Media posited that the plain and ordinary 
meaning of attached is “permanently fixed, joined, connected, or bound.” A1447. 
The examiner rejected this argument twice, correctly concluding that “it is clearly 
possible to loosen the attachment screw, to enable the pivoting of the camera 
relative to support (fixed part 2) while the camera is still attached to the support.” 
A1508-10; A1476.  After the third and final rejection based on Irifune, Global-
Media cancelled all the asserted claims on September 20, 2012 which effectively 
ended the case. By that time, all the parties had settled, except two.  A1515-19, 
A1460, A1465, A1469-74, A1493, A1502-06.

V. AdjustaCam’s Nuisance-Value Settlements and Demands 
 
 
Sakar, like its co-defendants, was served with a lawsuit and was then 
approached by AdjustaCam to discuss settlement of the case.  Nearly every 
defendant proceeded to settle for a dollar amount well under the cost to defend 
oneself against the infringement allegations, 20 out of 22 for less than 
.  
A1282 (AdjustaCam settlement agreement summary). 
 
Just two months after filing this lawsuit in July 2010, AdjustaCam executed 
its first nuisance-value settlement with defendant Trippe Manufacturing in the 
amount of 
.  A2182.  Soon thereafter, AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Klip Extreme, LLC and Software Brokers of America (D/B/A 
Intcomex) for 
, and a few months later AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Phoebe Micro and jWIN for 
 and 
, respectively. 
Id.  By the time AdjustaCam dismissed Sakar in 2012, AdjustaCam had entered 
into 20 out of 22 settlements for less than 
:  
• Twelve defendants for 
 or less;  
• Three defendants for an amount between 
;  
• Five defendants for an amount between 
; and  
A1282.  All of the payments made by the various defendants are clearly only a 
small fraction of the cost of defense of a patent infringement lawsuit.

A1283-85.  Of those 15 settlements, not a single agreement included an effective 
royalty rate between $1.25 and $1.50 per unit for the defendant’s known past sales 
figures.  Id.  Few were even close. 
The alleged basis for the target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit was two 
settlement and license agreements entered into in 20013 by one of AdjustaCam’s 
predecessors in interest, PAR Technologies, both of which included lump sum 
payments plus prospective running royalty components.  A1197; A1282; A1303-
06.  One of these agreements had a tiered prospective royalty structure ranging 
from 
 per unit as the number of units increased, and the other had 
a royalty structure of 
 per unit that decreased to 
 as the sales 
volume increased.  A0542-45; A0631.  From these two PAR Technologies 
agreements alone, to the exclusion of the more than twenty other licenses that do 
not support the proffered royalty rage, and without making any comparison of the 
PAR Technologies licenses to the facts of the case against Sakar, AdjustaCam and 
its expert took the unsupported position that “a royalty in the $1.25 to $1.50 frame” 
was an appropriate and consistent target for licensing discussions.  A1305-06. 
Moreover, this supposed “target” royalty was essentially fixed in 
AdjustaCam’s view, as it was determined with no regard for price of the accused 
                                                 
3 The PAR Technologies agreements were therefore dated five years prior to the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case.  See A0540 (indicating that the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case was 2006).

products sold by the defendants, the cost of the patented clip feature in the accused 
products, or even the number of units sold.  A1309-10 (characterizing $1.25 to 
$1.50 as the “intrinsic value of the patented feature” regardless of the sales price); 
A1311-12 (stating that the manufacturing cost of the patented camera clip is “not 
relevant” because “licensees have uniformly agreed to pay in the range of $1.25 to 
$1.50 per unit”); A1329-30 (explaining that a substantial increase in sales 
“wouldn’t affect my analysis because the target had always been in the range of 
$1.25 to $1.50”). 
AdjustaCam also tried to paint its target royalty as an established royalty.  
A1201 (“AdjustaCam’s settlement numbers were tied to a pre-established unit 
royalty of $1.25 - $1.50 per infringing device.”).  But AdjustaCam falls far short of 
the high standard for proving and established royalty because AdjustaCam did not 
show that the PAR Technologies licenses were of sufficient number and frequency 
“to establish a regular price for a license” and “reflect a general acquiescence in 
[the price’s] reasonableness,” that the royalty-establishing licenses were not 
settlements of threatened or actual litigation, and that the circumstances and rights 
of the licenses are comparable to those in the present lawsuit.  See, e.g., Rude v. 
Westcott, 130 U.S. 152, 165 (1889); Hanson v. Alpine Valley Ski Area, Inc., 718 
F.2d 1075, 1078 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  None of these factors are met in this case—the 
two PAR Technologies licenses were both settlements of litigation prior to this

case, and neither was shown by AdjustaCam to be in any way comparable to the 
dispute between AdjustaCam and Sakar other than the fact that both involve the 
’343 Patent.  A1196; A0631. 
In attempt to manufacture some credibility for its “target royalty,” six of 
AdjustaCam’s litigation settlement agreements were drafted to include 
 once a certain threshold of 
sales was met beyond a fixed amount said to be covered by the lump-sum 
payment]].  A0545-49.  This self-serving provision was included by AdjustaCam 
knowing full well that none of those six defendants would sell enough products to 
ever pay a running royalty during the term of the patent.  A0558 (AdjustaCam’s 
expert stating “I understand that AdjustaCam utilized this royalty structure because 
these licensees had a low volume of past sales it would be highly unlikely that total 
volume sales would exceed the units included in the lump-sum payment”); A1313-
14 (AdjustaCam’s expert admitting that none of the six licensees ever reached the 
maximum number of sales and had to pay a running royalty).  Conveniently, 
AdjustaCam set the meaninglessly high number of units threshold, when divided 
by the lump sum payment, to equate to an effective royalty for past sales of 
.  A0631-33.  In reality, the parties to those six 
agreements, like every other settling defendant, paid nuisance value (between 
) to settle with AdjustaCam.  A631-33. 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 30     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 105 of 242   Page ID #:105
25 
 
Thus, all of AdjustaCam’s settlement licenses in reality reflect a nuisance-
value lump sum payment, and AdjustaCam has no evidence that it ever approached 
any negotiations with an intention to obtain its alleged target royalty.  Indeed, 
AdjustaCam’s 30(b)(6) representative could not even verify that it was, at any 
time, aware of the number of units sold by any of the defendants with which it 
settled.  A1337-38.  Such information certainly does not appear in AdjustaCam’s 
expert’s report.   
AdjustaCam also made multiple settlement demands to Sakar that reflected  
nuisance value settlements, and were untied to Sakar’s sales of the accused 
cameras.  However, Sakar refused all of AdjustaCam’s settlement demands in 2011 
and 2012 because the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent were not infringed, 
invalid, and had been rejected by the U.S. Patent Office. 
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 
 
AdjustaCam sued Sakar and its dozens of co-defendants solely for the 
improper purpose of seeking nuisance-value settlement payments.  This patent 
lawsuit had nothing to do with any bona fide complaint of infringement.  Sakar 
should not have to bear the burden and expense of such bad faith abuses of the 
patent system. 
Twenty (20) out of twenty-two (22) of AdjustaCam’s settlements were for 
less than 
, which is a dollar amount constituting a small fraction of the 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 31     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 106 of 242   Page ID #:106
26 
 
cost of defense. Yet AdjustaCam desperately twisted this nuisance-value evidence 
in attempt to justify an unsupportable $1.25 per unit royalty demand—a supposed 
“target royalty” that never really existed and was never used as a target by anybody 
in settlement discussions.  In truth, the defendants universally paid off AdjustaCam 
because it was far cheaper than defending themselves, just as AdjustaCam 
intended. 
Sakar refused to pay to make this case go away because AdjustaCam was 
abusively accusing products that did not, and could not infringe the patent-in-suit, 
and was merely using the high cost of litigation defense for settlement leverage.  
For justice to be done, somebody had to challenge AdjustaCam’s baseless case and 
extortive business practices.  Sakar accepted the task. 
 
 AdjustaCam’s patent covers a camera that is claimed to rotate in a single 
axis of rotation.  But it is undisputed that AdjustaCam accused products, including 
Sakar’s, having ball-and-socket joints such that, by definition, the cameras can be 
rotated about multiple axes of rotation.  This impossibility of infringement was 
apparent when the lawsuit was filed, but AdjustaCam pursued the case anyway 
because proving infringement was never the point of this lawsuit.   
 
Even after the district court construed the claims decisively foreclosing 
AdjustaCam’s effort to avoid the single-axis-of-rotation claim requirement, 
AdjustaCam pressed on undeterred as long as Sakar refused to accept

Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 107 of 242   Page ID #:107
27 
 
AdjustaCam’s many nuisance-value settlement offers.  Clearly AdjustaCam 
assumed that eventually Sakar would take the easy way out and just pay to make 
this case go away, but AdjustaCam guessed wrong.  
 
Only after extensive and burdensome expert discovery solidified the long-
known and fatal shortcomings of AdjustaCam’s case, AdjustaCam simply walked 
away.  Finally conceding that its shakedown efforts against Sakar were futile and 
that its infringement case was doomed, AdjustaCam dismissed its case with 
prejudice, thus avoiding having to back up its allegations in court of infringement.   
To make matters worse, all Sakar’s time and money (
 in 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees) was wasted on defending this frivolous lawsuit 
even though AdjustaCam knew for nearly a year before Sakar was dismissed that 
Sakar’s accused ball and socket product did not infringe. 
Nuisance litigation like AdjustaCam’s cannot be encouraged, nor can it be 
immunized from fee-shifting merely because AdjustaCam eventually dismissed the 
case.  Although bad faith nuisance litigation is commonplace among today’s patent 
litigants, litigants are presumed to litigate in good faith.  Because AdjustaCam did 
not litigate in good faith, this case “stands out from the others” and is exceptional 
under Octane Fitness, and is also sufficiently egregious to warrant expert fee 
shifting.  This Court should declare as much and remand the case to determine the 
amount of Sakar’s recoverable fees.

STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
The denial of a motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.  Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 134 S. 
Ct. 1744, 1747 (2014) (“[A]n appellate court should review all aspects of a district 
court’s § 285 determination for abuse of discretion.”).   
A district court’s decision not to award expert fees under its inherent 
authority is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 
“The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate court’s 
correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: ‘A district court would 
necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the 
law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’”  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. 
at 1748 n. 2 (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990)). 
ARGUMENT 
 
I. The District Court Abused its Discretion by Not Finding This Case 
Exceptional and Egregious 
 
 
The Supreme Court in its recent Octane Fitness decision explained that, 
under 35 U.S.C. § 285, “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out from 
others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position 
(considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable 
manner in which the case was litigated.”  134 S. Ct. at 1756.  “District courts may

Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 109 of 242   Page ID #:109
29 
 
determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-case exercise of their 
discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.”  Id.  For particularly 
egregious cases, district courts also have the inherent authority to award expert 
fees.  MarcTec v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(explaining that district courts should exercise this inherent authority in cases 
involving fraud or bad faith where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
As noted above, the district court decided Sakar’s motion before Octane 
Fitness relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285.  In 
denying Sakar’s motion, the district court recited and applied the then-applicable 
law under Brooks Furniture Mfg. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. 
Cir. 2005), stating that absent material inappropriate conduct in litigation, “an 
exceptional case may only be found if ‘both (1) the litigation is brought in 
subjective bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively baseless.’”  A0005. 
Unlike under the Brooks Furniture standard relied on by the district court, 
the exceptionality standard now does not, for example, require proof of both 
objective baselessness and bad faith, require misconduct to be independently 
sanctionable, or require proof by clear and convincing evidence.  Octane Fitness, 
134 S. Ct. at 1757-58.  Here, because the district court erred by denying Sakar’s 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 35     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 110 of 242   Page ID #:110
30 
 
motion under the strict Brooks Furniture standard, it certainly also erred under the 
far less burdensome Octane Fitness standard as well.   
In denying Sakar’s motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, the district 
court misapprehended the evidence and the parties’ contentions to reach a 
manifestly incorrect result.  Under either the Brooks Furniture or Octane Fitness 
analytical framework, this “clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence” 
constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1748 n. 2. 
A. AdjustaCam Filed and Prosecuted This Case in Bad Faith 
 
According to the district court, “there is insufficient evidence that the action 
was brought in bad faith and for an improper purpose.”  A0006.  In fact, the 
evidence of bad faith was overwhelming. 
Not only did AdjustaCam pursue Sakar for two years on patent claims that 
were facially not infringed by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products, but it 
pressed on with its case even after the Patent Office rejected the claims on August 
12, 2011, and even after the Markman Order emphatically precluded any possible 
relief for AdjustaCam.  See infra.  All the while, AdjustaCam made Sakar spend 
considerable sums of money on discovery—including extensive expert 
discovery—defending against these baseless allegations.  To make matters worse, 
all this time and money was wasted on a frivolous lawsuit even though 
AdjustaCam knew that Sakar’s potential exposure was minimal.  A1784; A1226; 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 36     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 111 of 242   Page ID #:111
31 
 
A1362-63. 
This bad faith behavior is easily understood when one looks at 
AdjustaCam’s purpose in bringing its lawsuits—to extract nuisance-value 
settlements.  Even the district court conceded that “the smaller settlements suggest 
this case was a settlement driven case.”  A0007.  The merits of the cases had 
nothing to do with the filing and maintenance of the lawsuits.  As long as 
AdjustaCam could convince its target defendants that it was cheaper, and made 
more business sense, to pay a small sum of money to make the case go away than 
to defend themselves, AdjustaCam would continue to collect its money without 
ever having to risk its patent and justify its positions in court.  But AdjustaCam did 
not count on Sakar defending itself, and had no choice but to dismiss Sakar if it 
wanted to preserve its shakedown business. 
However, Sakar was not dismissed until after the U.S. Patent Officefinally 
rejected AdjustaCam’s claims on August 30, 2012.

1. AdjustaCam Brought this Case for the Improper Purpose of 
Obtaining Nuisance-Value Settlements 
 
As explained above, the record shows that AdjustaCam’s settlement 
agreements are all for nuisance value.  See supra Statement of Facts, Part V.  
Twenty (20) out of twenty-two (22) defendants paid less than 
 to settle. 
None of AdjustaCam’s post-hac efforts to align those nuisance-value 
agreements with its supposed damages calculations pass muster.  See supra 
Statement of Facts, Part V.  AdjustaCam’s fabrication of an unsupportable and 
unused “target” royalty (e.g., A1195-96), as well as its illusory and never-paid 
“running royalty” components of six of its settlements (A0545-49; A0558; A1313-
14; A0631-33), are no more than self-serving litigation-induced arguments.  In 
reality, the effective royalties paid by Sakar’s co-defendants were all over the map.  
A1283-85 (effective royalties ranging from 
 per unit).  Not 
even the two supposedly “foundational” PAR Technologies license agreements 
support a “target” (and, essentially, fixed) royalty of $1.25 to $1.50 per unit.  
A0542-45 (discussing royalty ranges from 
; A0631. 
AdjustaCam’s settlements, as well as the settlement demands made to Sakar, 
are not reasonably tied to any prior comparable licenses or the potential 
infringement exposure of any party.  The settlement payments are merely round

33 
 
numbers set to encourage defendants not to fight the lawsuit on the merits due to 
the far greater expense involved in doing so.  District courts cannot turn a blind eye 
to such flagrant bad faith.   
As this Court has observed, “low settlement offers . . . effectively ensure[] 
that [the patentee’s] baseless infringement allegations remained unexposed, 
allowing [the patentee] to continue to collect additional nuisance value 
settlements.”  Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, 653 F.3d 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 
2011); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. York Int’l Corp., 244 F. Supp. 2d 990, 997 
(W.D. Wis. 2002) (Bad faith litigation tactics “force defendants into settlement and 
away from their legitimate defenses.”); Artese v. Academy Collection Service, No. 
3:96-cv-2546-GLG, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186, at *10 (D. Conn. Jan. 18, 2000) 
(holding that the filing of many lawsuits seeking relatively small settlements “gives 
rise to a suspicion of barratry and champerty”).   
Here, AdjustaCam’s settlement amounts are very small compared to the cost 
of defense, showing that AdjustaCam’s desire is to obtain settlement revenue 
rather than actually pursue its targeted defendants in litigation.  When Sakar, after 
nearly two years, still refused to pay to settle and remained determined to vindicate 
its positions in the litigation, AdjustaCam’s response exposed its true purpose in 
suing Sakar.  Instead of trying to prove Sakar’s defenses wrong in court, 
AdjustaCam simply walked away from its case.  Such an “overall vexatious

litigation strategy” that is wasteful of judicial resources evidences bad faith.  See 
Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. v. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd., 726 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 
2013).    
Belated timing of dismissal can also evidence bad faith and justify fee 
shifting.  In Monolithic Power Systems, the case was deemed exceptional in large 
part because the plaintiff “withdrew its claims and granted covenants not to sue 
after substantial litigation had taken place,” “moving to dismiss only after 
[defendants] had completed their filings for the final pretrial conference, wasting 
the parties’ and the court’s resources.”  Id.  Likewise, here AdjustaCam waited two 
years to dismiss Sakar, and did not actually dismiss Sakar until after Sakar had 
incurred considerable expense in attorney and expert fees.  AdjustaCam cannot just 
lose interest and walk away with zero consequences after forcing Sakar to spend 
 in attorneys’ fees and expert fees to defend itself.   
In Ingenuity 13, LLC v. Doe, copyright plaintiffs were found to have acted in 
bad faith and sanctioned for fees in circumstances largely identical to those in this 
case.  No. 2:12-cv-8333-ODW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64564 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 
2013).  First, the plaintiffs engaged in a strategy to file lawsuits against many 
defendants.  Id. at *6-7.  Due to “the high cost of litigation,” “[m]ost defendants 
settled . . . , resulting in proceeds of millions of dollars due to the numerosity of 
defendants.”  Id.  “For defendants that refused to settle, the Principals engaged in 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 40     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 115 of 242   Page ID #:115
35 
 
vexatious litigation designed to coerce settlement. These lawsuits were filed using 
boilerplate complaints based on a modicum of evidence, calculated to maximize 
settlement profits by minimizing costs and effort.”  Importantly, like AdjustaCam, 
in Ingenuity 13 “[t]he Principals have shown little desire to proceed in these 
lawsuits when faced with a determined defendant.  Instead of litigating, they 
dismiss the case.”  Id. at *7.   
Courts have acknowledged in various circumstances that it is fundamentally 
unfair for a plaintiff to force a defendant to endure the substantial burden and 
expense of litigation and then lose interest and walk away from the case without 
any consequences.  See Colombrito v. Kelly, 764 F.2d 122, 134-35 (2d Cir. 1985) 
(noting that awarding fees would be appropriate “if a litigant had made a practice 
of repeatedly bringing potentially meritorious claims and then dismissing them 
with prejudice after inflicting substantial litigation costs on the opposing party and 
 the judicial system”); Upthegrove v. Health Prof’ls, LTD., No. 07-cv-0596-BBC, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4546, at *12 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 21, 2009) (“Plaintiff cannot 
expect to subject defendant Rose to a year of litigation and walk away with no 
consequences.”); compare Monolithic Power Sys., 726 F.3d at 1367 (affirming 
award of fees, emphasizing that vexatious case was dismissed “after substantial 
litigation had taken place . . . wasting the parties’ and the court’s resources”).

Section 285’s exceptional case provision exists precisely to prevent “gross 
injustice to an alleged infringer.” Mathis v. Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 755 (Fed. Cir. 
1988).  Shackling Sakar with considerable and unjustifiable litigation costs is 
exceptional and abusive.

2. Nuisance Litigation is Exceptional and Egregious 
 
It is no secret that nuisance litigation brought by patent assertion entities is 
now fairly common and has become its own lucrative industry.  See, e.g., Colleen 
V. Chien, Patent Trolls by the Numbers, Santa Clara University Studies Research 
Paper No. 08-13, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2233041 (March 13, 2013) 
(explaining that patent assertion entities file the majority patent lawsuits in the 
U.S., primarily targeting non-technology companies). 
It would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this state of affairs that 
such litigation misconduct is not “exceptional” within the meaning of Section 285.  
Octane Fitness explained that “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out 
from others” regarding weak merits positions or litigation misconduct.  134 S. Ct. 
at 1756.  But the Court certainly did not suggest, let alone hold, that courts should 
allow themselves to become desensitized to bad faith nuisance litigation just 
because it is commonplace.   
Section 285 is supposed to be remedial—to correct for unfairness and 
injustice in a flexible, fact-specific manner.  See Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 
1753, 1756 n.6; see also Kilopass Tech., Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302,  
1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court was so cynical 
as to assume that patent litigation ordinarily involves bad faith and misconduct.  
The obvious assumption of Section 285 is that patent litigation will be brought and 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 43     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 118 of 242   Page ID #:118

conducted in good faith, and that a case is “exceptional” when it sufficiently 
deviates from this expectation of litigants.  Cf. Medtronic Navigation, Inc. v. 
BrainLAB Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH, 603 F.3d 943, 954 (Fed. Cir. 
2010) (“[T]here is a presumption that an assertion of infringement of a duly 
granted patent is made in good faith.”). 
Moreover, using the court system to further AdjustaCam’s extortive business 
practices is the kind of egregious bad faith that warrants shifting of expert fees.  
MarcTec, 664 F.3d at 921.  Bad faith assertions of frivolous lawsuits unreasonably 
burden the litigation targets and the judicial system.  Awarding expert fees is 
especially appropriate where a plaintiff’s vexatious misconduct forces a defendant 
to incur those expert fees unnecessarily, as those fees are not compensable under 
Section 285.  Id. at 921-22 (holding that expert fees were properly awarded 
because “Cordis was forced to incur expert witness expenses to rebut MarcTec’s 
unreliable and irrelevant expert testimony,” such that “MarcTec’s vexatious 
conduct and bad faith increased  the cost of litigation in ways that are not 
compensated under § 285”).  Here, as in MarcTec, AdjustaCam’s experts’ 
testimony was fatally flawed and could not possibly have proven infringement or 
AdjustaCam’s alleged damages.  AdjustaCam only proceeded into expert 
discovery to apply more pressure to Sakar for a nuisance-value settlement.  For 
Sakar to have to spend $19,589 on experts to rebut AdjustaCam’s experts’ baseless 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 44     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 119 of 242   Page ID #:119
39 
 
allegations, on top of all the other misconduct and expense inflicted by 
AdjustaCam in seeking nuisance-value settlements, is a grave injustice that cannot 
be permitted.  Id. at 921 (inherent authority should be exercised to shift expert fees 
where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”). 
Patent litigation is supposed to resolve legitimate disputes surrounding bona 
fide infringement allegations, not facilitate nuisance-value patent monetization 
campaigns.  See Eon-Net, 653 F.3d at 1328 (“[T]he appetite for licensing revenue 
cannot overpower a litigant’s and its counsel’s obligation to file cases reasonably 
based in law and fact and to litigate those cases in good faith.”).  This Court should 
take this opportunity to clarify that litigation brought for the purposes of extorting 
nuisance-value settlements is exceptional will not be tolerated or immunized from 
fee-shifting simply because it is widespread.  And to the extent a nuisance 
litigation campaign cross into the expert discovery phase of a case, those expert 
expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
3. Nuisance Litigation Should be Discouraged 
 
Section 285 and Octane Fitness recognize that the specter of fee-shifting is 
intended to have a deterrent effect on bad faith litigation and misconduct.  134 S. 
Ct. at 1756 n.6 (reminding district courts of “the need in particular circumstances 
to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence”).  That purpose would 
be frustrated if all one had to do to avoid any possible fee-shifting is dismiss its 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 45     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 120 of 242   Page ID #:120
40 
 
case and avoid losing on the merits.  AdjustaCam cannot avoid the expensive and 
wasteful consequences of its extortion tactics simply because it dismissed Sakar 
from the case.  See Kilopass, 738 F.3d at 1317 (“[T]rial courts retain broad 
discretion to make findings of exceptionality under § 285 in a wide variety of 
circumstances.”).   
To be clear, a plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of a meritless case should be 
encouraged.  But when a case is brought for reasons unrelated to the merits and to 
obtain nuisance-value settlements, as it was here, the incentive to dismiss must also 
include an incentive to dismiss at a meaningful time—i.e., before substantial 
expense and burden is inflicted on the defendant.  This Court should clarify that 
Section 285 provides those incentives, and that such plaintiffs who pursue their 
cases for too long before dismissing will be viewed as acting in bad faith and will 
be ordered to pay a defendant’s attorney’s fees.  And again, to the extent a 
nuisance litigation campaign cross into the expert discovery phase of a case, those 
expert expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
Using the United States judiciary to leverage nuisance-value settlements also 
reflects selfish opportunism and unreasonably burdens the courts.  See Artese, 2000 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 at *10-11 (“[I]t is not merely the prejudice and costs to the 
opposing party but also the effect upon the judicial system of such litigation. When 
we consider the numerous other cases commenced by this plaintiff . . . there has 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 46     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 121 of 242   Page ID #:121
41 
 
been indeed a substantial burden on the judicial system.”).  Behavior that treats the 
judiciary as a pawn for nuisance-value settlement negotiations and makes courts 
waste considerable time and resources should be strongly discouraged.   
By contrast, defendants like Sakar, who do not pay a patentee in a nuisance 
litigation simply to make a lawsuit go away, play an important role in the patent 
system.  Such defendants insist that plaintiffs justify their positions and, when the 
plaintiffs cannot or will not do so, will vindicate their defenses in court.  But for 
defendants like Sakar, abusive nuisance litigants would never be exposed because 
every case would settle and conceal the misconduct.  Given the remedial nature of 
Section 285, Sakar and other similarly-situated defendants should not be 
discouraged from taking this more onerous and expensive course, helping to ensure 
that the patent system is not abused. 
Absent a meaningful fee-shifting standard where fees are reasonably 
attainable, defendants are more likely to simply settle nuisance litigations because 
the financial downsides are overwhelming.  If AdjustaCam’s conduct is not 
deemed exceptional and egregious in this case, it will embolden nuisance litigants 
to continue their abusive conduct unchecked.

B. The Accused Cameras Could Not Possibly Have Infringed 
 
The district court agreed with AdjustaCam that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included constrained ball-and-socket joints that restricted movement to 
some extent.  A0006. According to the district court, this constricted movement 
made it possible for AdjustaCam to prevail in proving infringement: 
[i]f the ball and socket joint truly restricts the range of movement 
such that it cannot rotate about multiple axes, the constrained ball and 
socket joint could meet the claim limitation which requires the hinge 
member being rotatably attached to the camera in a single axis of 
rotation.  Since one could reasonably argue Defendants’ products 
meet the “rotatably attached” limitation, AdjustaCam’s infringement 
theories are not objectively baseless. 
 
A0006.  The problem is that the above-emphasized portion—the premise and sine 
qua non of the district court’s conclusion—is not true and does not even reflect 
AdjustaCam’s position.  It is undisputed that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included cameras that were in fact capable of rotating about multiple axes 
with respect to the socket—they could be both twisted and tilted up and down. 
AdjustaCam never argued that the constrained ball-and-socket joints were 
incapable of rotating about multiple axes—it merely posited that the different 
rotations were “separate.”  A0482-83 (“[I]f I rotate it around to the center, there is 
nothing that forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”); A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”); A0485-87 (“This happens to be a constrained 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 48     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 123 of 242   Page ID #:123
43 
 
ball and socket joint.  So it can [1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it 
may be able to [3] move to the side.”).  
On this record, there is no question that the cameras of the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products were capable of rotating in at least two different and distinct 
directions with respect to the sockets, not merely rotating about the claimed and 
singular “first axis of rotation.”  ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“said camera, when the 
hinge member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said 
hinge member”).  It was objectively baseless for AdjustaCam to contend that such 
cameras were “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  One could not 
reasonably argue otherwise. 
Importantly, AdjustaCam was not advancing a theory of infringement under 
the doctrine of equivalents, and so its case hinged on proof of literal infringement. 
See, e.g., A0996-97 and A1160-61 (AdjustaCam’s expert report presenting only 
direct, literal infringement theory). 
Long before the district court’s Markman Order formally doomed 
AdjustaCam’s case, the plain language of the claims, and especially in light of the 
specification, made clear that the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products could not 
possibly infringe.  A0022 (“The claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ 
object as rotating about a single axis.”); A0021 (“Every reference to a ‘rotatably 
attached’ object in the specification and claims describes the attachment as 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 49     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 124 of 242   Page ID #:124
44 
 
permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).  From the outset of this lawsuit, 
no reasonable plaintiff could have expected to succeed in proving infringement. 
The situation would be somewhat different if AdjustaCam honestly did not 
know that infringement was impossible to prove at the outset of the case, but later 
discovered that it could not prevail.  Here, such ignorance is implausible given the 
readily apparent functionality of the accused products and the simplicity of the 
patent and its claims.  But even if AdjustaCam could legitimately plead ignorance, 
ignorance is no excuse to continue undeterred—for nearly five months, which 
included considerable and expensive expert discovery—after the district court’s 
decisive Markman ruling in Sakar’s favor.  A0013-27 (April 10, 2012 Markman 
Order).  Here, as in MarcTec, AdjustaCam “not only initiated a frivolous lawsuit, it 
persisted in advancing unfounded arguments that unnecessarily extended this 
litigation and caused [defendant] to incur needleless litigation expenses. This 
vexatious conduct is, by definition, litigation misconduct, and provides a separate 
and independent basis supporting the district court’s determination that this case is 
exceptional.”  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, at 920-21 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012).    
C. AdjustaCam’s Validity Positions Were Frivolous 
 
As explained above, AdjustaCam advanced the following frivolous 
argument in response to the clear anticipation of its claims by Irifune: “With 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 50     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 125 of 242   Page ID #:125
45 
 
Irifune, the camera is not even attached to the hinge member until fully tightened 
down using camera attachment shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and 
(11).” A1263.  Using the exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” offered in 
the reexamination, AdjustaCam’s expert Dr. Muskivitch opined that, “[o]nce the 
camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera cannot rotate about a first axis 
relative to the hinge member.”  Id. 
These concocted arguments were objectively baseless for several reasons.  
First, AdjustaCam’s illogical attempt to narrow the meaning of “rotatably 
attached” contradicts the claim language and the specification of the ’343 Patent.  
If the camera disclosed in the ’343 Patent was “permanently fixed to,” or had to be 
fully tightened down to the hinge member, then the camera could not rotate about 
the first axis of rotation as the claims and specification require.  Indeed, such 
arguments contradict AdjustaCam’s own proposed construction of “rotatably 
attached” in this litigation (“connected such that the connected object is capable of 
being rotated”).  A2813-14.  The Irifune camera is certainly “capable of being 
rotated”—e.g., when it is partially unscrewed from the threaded camera attachment 
shaft on the hinge.  AdjustaCam’s argument that a camera is not rotatably attached 
to a hinge member unless it is “permanently fixed to” or fully tightened down to 
the hinge member also contradicts the district court’s Markman Order because 
such a camera would not be capable of rotation about any axis.  A0021 (“Every 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 51     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 126 of 242   Page ID #:126
46 
 
reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object in the specification and claims describes 
the attachment as permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).   AdjustaCam 
could not reasonably expect to prevail against Sakar’s invalidity arguments based 
on Irifune. 
II. AdjustaCam’s Appeal Must be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction 
 
Consistent with AdjustaCam’s bad faith overreaching and indifference to the 
merits of this litigation, AdjustaCam brought its own affirmative appeal to this 
Court where subject matter jurisdiction is indisputably lacking.  There is no legal 
support whatsoever for AdjustaCam’s attempt to appeal a claim construction issue 
that it lost in the district court, made no effort to preserve for appeal, and expressly 
extinguished when it dismissed its case against Sakar with prejudice. This 
frivolous appeal only compounds the exceptionality of this case and causes Sakar 
to incur further needless legal expenses. 
An “actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at 
the time the complaint was filed.”  Benitec Austl, Ltd. v. Nucleonics, Inc., 495 F.3d 
1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 
(1974)).  “Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold requirement for a court’s power 
to exercise jurisdiction over a case, and no amount of ‘prudential reasons’ or 
perceived increases in efficiency, however sound, can empower a federal court to 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 52     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 127 of 242   Page ID #:127
47 
 
hear a case where there is no extant case or controversy.”  Dow Jones & Co., Inc. 
v. Ablaise Ltd., 606 F.3d 1338, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
AdjustaCam filed its notice of appeal seeking review of the district court’s 
claim construction rulings.  A0193.  But by that time, Sakar had already been 
dismissed with prejudice from the case and given a covenant not to be sued in the 
future for infringement of the ’343 Patent.  A1955-57; A0319-20; A0158.  The 
dismissal and covenant extinguished any ongoing disputes between AdjustaCam 
and Sakar concerning the infringement and validity of the ’343 Patent.  Indeed, 
when dismissing Sakar, AdjustaCam even argued that its covenant divested the 
district court of subject matter jurisdiction over Sakar’s declaratory judgment 
counterclaims, citing Dow Jones, 606 F.3d at 1348 and Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. 
Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  A1955-57.  If there 
is no jurisdiction over Sakar’s non-infringement and invalidity counterclaims due 
to a lack of an ongoing controversy, certainly there can be no jurisdiction over 
AdjustaCam’s underlying infringement claims that were dismissed with prejudice. 
This Court has often recognized its inability to reach claim construction 
issues that are not subject to an ongoing case or controversy. See, e.g, SanDisk 
Corp. v. Kingston Tech. Co., 695 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[W]here, as 
here, a party’s claim construction arguments do not affect the final judgment 
entered by the court, they are not reviewable. . . . Without a final judgment as to 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 53     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 128 of 242   Page ID #:128
48 
 
the infringement or validity of these claims, the court’s claim constructions that 
impact only these withdrawn claims are not properly before us.”); Jang v. Boston 
Sci. Corp., 532 F.3d 1330, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (resolving claim construction 
issues “that do not actually affect the infringement controversy between the 
parties” would result in impermissible advisory opinion because “[t]he Supreme 
Court has explicitly held that Article III does not permit the courts to resolve issues 
when it is not clear that the resolution of the question will resolve a concrete 
controversy between interested parties”); see also NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, 
Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 
Although AdjustaCam purports to appeal from the district court’s final 
judgment, because that final judgment was in no way based on the claim 
construction ruling, but was instead based entirely on the mutual consent of the 
parties to end the case, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the 
claim constructions.   
This is not a case where the parties consented to a judgment of non-
infringement based on the claim constructions to allow for appeal of the 
construction.  See, e.g., SanDisk, 695 F.3d at 1353 (“SanDisk voluntarily withdrew 
the ’893 and ’808 patents and claims 1 and 10 of the ’842 patent from this action, 
and it does not dispute that the district court never entered a stipulated judgment of 
Case: 13-1665      Document: 43     Page: 54     Filed: 09/24/2014
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 129 of 242   Page ID #:129
49 
 
non-infringement with respect to these claims. Thus, these claims do not present a 
current infringement controversy before this court.”). 
Here, AdjustaCam made no effort whatsoever to preserve any challenges to 
the district court’s claim constructions when it decided to dismiss its case against 
Sakar.  Even in defending AdjustaCam’s litigation positions and opposing Sakar’s 
motion for attorneys’ fees, AdjustaCam noted no disagreement with the district 
court’s claim constructions.  A0258-62; A0262 (arguing that “AdjustaCam’s 
infringement positions are entirely consistent with the Court’s construction”). 
This Court cannot hear AdjustaCam’s appeal because it lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction over the challenges raised to the claim construction rulings by the 
district court.  AdjustaCam’s appeal must be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be 
reversed, this case should be declared exceptional and egregious, and the case 
should be remanded for a determination of the amount of attorneys’ fees and expert 
fees owed to Sakar.   
 
Additionally, AdjustaCam’s appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.

STATEMENT OF RELATED CASES 
No other appeal in or from this same civil action was previously before this 
Court or any other court of appeals.  Newegg Inc., Newegg.com, Inc., and 
Rosewill, Inc. (collectively, “Newegg” or “the Newegg Defendants”) and their 
undersigned counsel are unaware of any other actions now pending in this or any 
other court that will directly affect or be directly affected by this Court’s decision 
in the present appeal.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT 
Newegg’s Cross-Appeal: 
The district court had original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1338(a).  Newegg filed a timely and proper notice of appeal under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4.  This Court has appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 
AdjustaCam’s Appeal: 
For reasons discussed below, this Court does not have subject matter 
jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s appeal and AdjustaCam’s appeal must be 
dismissed. 
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES 
 
1. 
Whether the district court erred by failing to find this case exceptional 
and egregious to award Newegg its attorneys’ fees and expert fees under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 285 and its inherent authority, respectively, despite clear and unrebutted evidence 
showing that this lawsuit was meritless, and that it was filed and prosecuted to 
leverage the high cost and burden of litigation to coerce a nuisance-value 
settlement payment from Newegg. 
 
2. 
Whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s 
appeal, given that the case on the merits was mutually and voluntarily dismissed in 
its entirety, and no case or controversy remains between the parties.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
AdjustaCam, LLC (“AdjustaCam”) brought this action in July 2010 against 
59 defendants, including the Newegg Defendants, alleging that certain camera 
products sold by Newegg infringed United States Patent No. 5,855,343 (“the ’343 
Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”  A0004.  The ’343 Patent is owned by Global-
Media Group, LLC, and AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of the patent.  
A1789. 
Immediately after filing suit, AdjustaCam began seeking to settle with the 
defendants for amounts far below the cost of defense.  All defendants other than 
the Newegg Defendants and Sakar International, Inc. (“Sakar”) settled with 
AdjustaCam well before trial and were dismissed.  A0004.  Generally, each 
defendant paid [[
]] and, in many cases, [[
]] as a 
settlement fee, and always as a round number.  A1282. 
A Markman hearing was held on February 9, 2012 to construe various claim 
terms of the ’343 Patent.  A0013.  Magistrate Judge Love issued a Markman order 
on April 10, 2012, which was subsequently adopted in full by Chief Judge Davis 
on June 7, 2012.  A0013-27; A0012 (“the Markman Order”).
Among the terms addressed in the Markman Order was the term “[r]otatably 
attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach.” A0020-
23.  The parties disputed whether the term as used in the claims “allow[s] for a 
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 145 of 242   Page ID #:145
3
‘rotatably attached’ object to rotate over more than a single axis.”  A0020.  The 
district court agreed with the defendants, noting that “[t]he claims plainly describe 
each ‘rotatably attached’ object as rotating about a single axis.”  A0022.1  The 
district court also explained that “[e]very reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object 
in the specification and claims describes the attachment as permitting motion over 
a single axis of rotation.”  A0021.
Although the term “did not require 
construction,” the district court nonetheless resolved the claim interpretation 
dispute, holding that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are limited 
to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23 (prohibiting the parties from contradicting 
the district court’s resolution of the dispute as the case went forward). 
In the few months following the April 2012 Markman Order, AdjustaCam 
quickly proceeded to settle with and dismiss the few remaining defendants from 
the case.  A1282; A0147-53.  These companies generally paid AdjustaCam 
[[
]] to be dismissed, which is consistent with the pre-Markman
nuisance settlements—and again, always as a round number.  A1282. 
1 As the district court explained (A0020), the claims of the ’343 Patent referred 
consistently to a “rotatably attached” hinge member rotating in only one of two 
specific axes of rotation, depending on whether it was rotating with respect to the 
camera or the support frame. See, e.g., Claim 1 (“a hinge member adapted to be 
rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge member is so 
attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge member”); 
(“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . said hinge member 
rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support frame, said first axis 
of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis of rotation”).

On August 27, 2012, after considerable expert discovery was completed and 
the case was on the verge of summary judgment and Daubert proceedings,
AdjustaCam filed a motion to dismiss its claims against the Newegg Defendants 
with prejudice.  A2136-37.  The motion also sought to dismiss the Newegg 
Defendants’ invalidity and non-infringement declaratory judgment counterclaims 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, with prejudice, based on a covenant not to 
sue that extinguished the case or controversy with respect to the counterclaims.  Id.
According to AdjustaCam, the reason for its motion was that it had “recently 
resolved its claims against almost all of the remaining Defendants,” including 
defendants whose products were sold by Newegg, such that “NewEgg/Rosewill is 
no longer selling unlicensed webcams manufactured by any other Defendant.”  
A2137.  Thus, AdjustaCam professed a “desire[] to simplify this case by focusing 
its claims going forward solely upon Defendant Sakar and Defendant Kohl’s, 
which is accused of infringement solely on account of Sakar manufactured 
products.  NewEgg/Rosewill’s remaining damages exposure . . . is relatively de
minimis, and is dwarfed by the damages exposure of Sakar.”  A2137-38. 
Newegg opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that its declaratory 
judgment counterclaims should not be dismissed with prejudice.  A2093-95 
(explaining that “the covenant not to sue offered by AdjustaCam lacks certain 
critical elements required to protect Newegg from charges of infringement by 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 147 of 242   Page ID #:147

AdjustaCam or its successors regarding future Newegg products”).  AdjustaCam 
subsequently filed a new, unopposed motion that sought to dismiss its infringement 
claims with prejudice and Newegg’s counterclaims without prejudice, which the 
district court granted.  A1986-87; A155. 
Newegg then filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, which was 
denied.  A0156, A0160.  Newegg also submitted an unopposed bill of costs in the 
amount of $8,492.66, but when the district court entered final judgment, the 
judgment did not reflect Newegg’s unopposed costs, erroneously stating that “all 
costs are to be borne by the party that incurred them.”  A0199-200, A0001-03.
Newegg moved the district court to amend the erroneous judgment, A0199-
200, but when the correction was not made before the appeal deadline Newegg 
filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the denial of its motion for attorneys’ 
fees.  A0160; A0195.   AdjustaCam filed a separate notice of appeal the same day, 
seeking review of the district court’s claim construction order.  A0193.  Although 
AdjustaCam’s notice of appeal also referred to the district court’s final judgment, 
that final judgment was not premised on any claim construction issues, nor did 
AdjustaCam seek a consent judgment incorporating the claim construction order as 
the basis for a judgment of non-infringement.  Rather, the final judgment merely 
reflected the parties’ agreed mutual dismissal of the case.  A0001-03; A1986-87.

The appeals were docketed by this Court but then deactivated due to 
Newegg’s pending motion to correct the judgment.  Dkt. No. 17.  When the district 
court had still not decided Newegg’s motion to correct the judgment after six 
months, Newegg withdrew the motion, having been forced by the district court’s 
extensive and unexplained delay in ruling on a simple clerical motion to forego 
recovering Newegg’s costs to avoid further delay of this appeal.2  A0162.  This 
Court subsequently reactivated the appeal.  Dkt. No. 20. 
Meanwhile, after Newegg had withdrawn its motion to correct the judgment, 
and shortly before this appeal was reactivated, the Supreme Court decided Octane
Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 (2014), which 
relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
I.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Unable to squeeze a nuisance-value settlement payment from Newegg after 
more than two years of litigation, patent assertion entity AdjustaCam decided it 
2 Newegg believed that further delay would materially prejudice its ability to 
recover any amounts subsequently awarded against AdjustaCam because 
AdjustaCam is a shell entity that can quickly and easily be taken into bankruptcy 
and have its assets dispersed.  Newegg has been prejudiced by such delay in the 
past. See Kelora Systems, LLC v. Target Corp. et al., No. 11-1548 (C.D. Cal.) at 
ECF Nos. 543, 551 (Newegg’s award of costs in the amount of $28,304.80 and 
subsequent mooting of motion to appoint receiver due to Kelora’s bankruptcy). 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 149 of 242   Page ID #:149
7
would rather dismiss Newegg with prejudice than face the inevitability that this 
case would be resolved on the merits in Newegg’s favor.   
AdjustaCam never genuinely believed that Newegg infringed its patent, nor 
reasonably could it.  The ’343 Patent covers adjustable cameras with very precisely 
defined axes of rotation that are facially absent from Newegg’s accused products.  
Even after the district court emphatically rejected AdjustaCam’s attempt to 
sidestep its patent’s claim language, AdjustaCam pressed on with the case and 
made overreaching and unsupportable nuisance-value settlement demands.  
Finally, when summary judgment briefing was underway and trial was looming, 
AdjustaCam, having already obtained settlement payments from almost all other 
defendants, cut and ran to avoid putting its patents in jeopardy and thus preserve its 
shakedown business.
The filing and prosecution of this action by AdjustaCam was solely intended 
to extort nuisance-value settlement fees from defendants, not to resolve any 
legitimate claims of infringement or damages.  Baseless cases that abuse the 
judicial system for financial gain must be found exceptional and warrant fee 
shifting. 
By the time Newegg filed its motion for fees, AdjustaCam had forced 
Newegg to spend more than $350,000 in attorneys’ fees and expert fees to defend 
itself, not to mention the considerable additional expense of the present appeal.  
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 150 of 242   Page ID #:150
8
A1793-94.3  Prevailing parties that are willing to contest meritless claims rather 
than succumb to the offer of a nuisance settlement serve as important safeguards 
for the system.  With the proliferation of mass patent litigation based on a business 
model of seeking quick, small nuisance settlements from many targets without a 
genuine intent to pursue the case to the merits, this safeguard is particularly 
important because such broadside abuses sour opinion leaders and the public on 
the patent system.   Yet, unless fees are shifted in cases such as this one, the 
decision to incur big expenses to defend meritless cases, rather than paying a tiny 
fraction to settle, become so unattractive that there will be even less resistance to 
this cynical but successful patent monetization approach.  
II.
THE PARTIES
AdjustaCam is an LLC that is exclusively in the business of patent litigation.  
As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acacia Research Group, LLC, its business 
follows the all-too-familiar model of using the burden and expense of patent 
litigation as leverage to extort settlement fees from defendants.  A1779. 
Newegg is an online-only retailer that primarily sells computers, computer 
components and peripherals, and consumer electronics.  Newegg conducts its 
business primarily via www.newegg.com.  Rosewill is Newegg’s private-label 
3 Approximately $60,000 of additional expert fees were invoiced to Newegg via 
the Parsons Behle firm.  Newegg seeks recovery of all its fees and expenses, 
including these additional expert fees and attorneys’ fees incurred during and 
subsequent to its fee briefing before the district court. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 151 of 242   Page ID #:151

brand for certain products.  Rosewill does not manufacture its products, but simply 
purchases and re-sells its products under its “Rosewill” brand name. 
Many of AdjustaCam’s target defendants in this case were successful online 
retailers like Amazon.com and Newegg, who simply purchased and re-sold the 
accused cameras, not manufacturers who actually made the accused cameras. 
III.
ADJUSTACAM’S INFRINGEMENT ALLEGATIONS
AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of United States Patent No. 5,855,343 
(“the ’343 Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”   A1789.   The ’343 Patent is generally 
directed to a camera clip that supports a camera when sitting on a flat surface or 
when attached to an object, such as a computer monitor: 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 152 of 242   Page ID #:152
10
’343 Patent, Figs. 1, 2, 4.  The clip allows the camera to rotate in two distinct 
directions about distinct axes of rotation. 
First, as shown in Fig. 1, the camera can be rotated to pan side-to-side.  The 
specification explains: “[h]inge member 16 is rotatably attached to camera 12, 
where camera 12 rotates over a first axis 26 in a direction shown by arrow 28 
relative to hinge member 16.”  ’343 Patent, at 4:17-19.  Second, as shown in Fig. 2, 
the camera can be tilted upward and downward.  The specification explains: 
“[h]inge member 16 rotates over a second axis 32 in the direction shown by arrow 
34 relative to support frame 18.  First axis 26 is perpendicular to second axis 32.”  
 ’343 Patent, at 4:21-24. 
 
These particular axes of rotation are expressly required by all independent 
claims in the ’343 Patent.  See, e.g., ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“a hinge member 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 153 of 242   Page ID #:153
11
adapted to be rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge 
member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge 
member”); id (“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member . . . , said 
hinge member rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support 
frame, said first axis of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis 
of rotation”).4
To be clear, the camera products claimed in the ’343 Patent require three
distinct components of importance to this case: (1) a camera; (2) a hinge member; 
and (3) a support frame. While the camera product—including the hinge 
member—rotates about two axes, the camera of the ’343 Patent itself only rotates 
about one axis; this is what is described, and this is what is claimed. This is evident 
from the claim language, which specifies that the camera is “rotatably attached” to 
the hinge member of the claimed apparatus such that the camera rotates about a 
single axis of rotation (the claimed “first axis of rotation”).  Similarily, the support
frame of the apparatus is itself “rotatably attached” to the hinge member such that 
the support frame rotates relative to the hinge member about a separate, single axis 
of rotation (the claimed “second axis of rotation”). Importantly, the two axes of 
rotation with respect to the three components are distinct, and are distinctly 
claimed.  Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the term “[r]otatably

attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach” as used in 
the claims indicated that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are 
limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  
Unlike the camera covered by the ’343 Patent, AdjustaCam accused 
products do not rotate about a single axis of rotation. Instead, these products (the 
“Accused Ball-and-Socket Products”) include a camera having a ball connected to 
a support frame having a socket, the two components being connected via a ball-
and-socket joint, which facilitates rotation about multiple axes.
This constitutes substantial and material differences between the Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products and the ’343 Patent claims, as illustrated by the 
following photographs of the accused Rosewill RCM-8163 (below left) and 
Hercules Classic (below right) webcams, which are representative of the Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products: 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 155 of 242   Page ID #:155
13
A1786; see also A1755-75.  The nature of these ball-and-socket joints is that they 
allow for rotation for each of the parts of the camera product about multiple axes—
the camera is able to spin and pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to 
the socket (not just a single axis), and the support frame is likewise able to spin and 
pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to the ball (not just a single axis).  
A1755-75.  Comparing the accused products to the claims and specification of the 
’343 Patent clearly shows that AdjustaCam’s infringement allegations were 
baseless.  A young child could see and understand the difference. 
Another key reason the ’343 Patent claims do not map to the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products is the fact that, unlike the three distinct components claimed 
in the ’343 Patent, the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products have only two distinct
components of importance to this case: (1) a camera having a ball; and (2) a 
support frame having a socket.  The use of a ball-and-socket joint between these 
two components eliminates the need for a third element—an intermediate hinge 
member—as claimed in the ’343 Patent.  A ball-and-socket camera is simply an 
inapt product to accuse of infringement given the precisely claimed three-part 
camera of the ’343 Patent and its limited rotation capabilities.  The Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products work in a fundamentally different and, arguably, more 
streamlined and elegant, manner. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 156 of 242   Page ID #:156
14
Because of its expressly claimed hinge member, the ’343 Patent claims 
require that the camera and support frame each be able to independently rotate 
about only a single axis of rotation.  See A0022 (district court explaining that 
“[t]he claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ object [i.e., the camera and 
support frame] as rotating about a single axis”).  But in the Accused Ball-and-
Socket Products, both the camera and support frame components can rotate about 
multiple axes with respect to each other.   The mere fact that the cameras can be 
both twisted and tilted about the socket ends the infringement inquiry because it 
establishes rotation of the camera about at least two distinct axes.  The Markman
order conclusively established that such a configuration was outside the scope of 
the claims of the ’343 Patent.   
Long before the district court’s Markman Order, however, the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products were facially non-infringing—the ball-and-socket joints are 
prominent and plainly visible, and their functionality is plain.  At the outset of this 
lawsuit no reasonable litigant could realistically have expected to avoid summary 
judgment.  Yet even after the Markman Order cemented AdjustaCam’s inability to 
prove infringement by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products, AdjustaCam pressed 
on with the case in hopes of recovering a nuisance settlement. 
After the Markman Order, AdjustaCam served the expert report of John C. 
Muskivitch who—despite the district court’s clarification that “rotatably attached” 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 157 of 242   Page ID #:157
15
objects are “limited to a single axis of rotation”—opined that the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products included a hinge member “adapted to be rotatably attached to 
the camera.”  See generally A1253-60.  By continuing to press its frivolous 
infringement arguments, and by forcing Newegg to retain a testifying expert to 
respond to such arguments, AdjustaCam’s bad faith is evident. Eltech Sys. Corp. v. 
PPG Indus., Inc., 903 F.2d 805, 811 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“Where, as here, the 
patentee is manifestly unreasonable in assessing infringement, while continuing to 
assert infringement in court, and inference is proper of bad faith.”). 
 
AdjustaCam’s only defense of its baseless case is a hollow contention that 
its infringement allegations are consistent with the district court’s constructions 
because “what Newegg/Rosewill allege is a ball and socket joint is actually a 
modified ball and socket joint . . . because there is a channel that restricts 
movement.”  A1194.   
A1194-95.  According to AdjustaCam, “[t]his restricted movement results in two 
functionally independent joints which have ranges of movement independent of 
each other.”   Id.   In other words, AdjustaCam’s nonsensical position is that even 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 158 of 242   Page ID #:158
16
though the camera can move in two different and distinct directions with respect to 
the support frame, the fact that a channel restricts that movement compared to a 
channel-less camera means that somehow the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products 
are “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.
 
The testimony of AdjustaCam’s expert highlights the absurdity of this 
contention.  In Dr. Muskovitch’s deposition, he explained that the various rotations 
are “separate” because “if I rotate it around to the center, there is nothing that 
forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”  A0482-83; A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”).  Even though the supposedly “constrained” ball-
and-socket joint enables the camera to rotate in multiple directions, as long as one 
only chooses to rotate the camera in only a single direction at a time, Dr. 
Muskovitch concluded that the joint is “limited to a single axis of rotation.”   The 
’343 Patent claims do not permit this baseless theory, which is akin to arguing that 
an airplane is merely a car unless and until it is actually in flight. 
While the presence of two axes of rotation for the camera would be 
sufficient to preclude infringement, Dr. Muskovitch in fact conceded that there are 
at least three different axis of rotation for the camera in each Accused Ball-and-
Socket Product: “This happens to be a constrained ball and socket joint.  So [the 
camera] can [1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it may be able to [3] 
move to the side.”  A0485-87.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 159 of 242   Page ID #:159
17
Based on the foregoing, there could never have been any infringement by the 
Accused Ball-and-Socket Products. AdjustaCam’s argument that a garden-variety 
ball-and-socket joint can somehow morph into, and be recharacterized as, two 
separate (single axis) joints is manifestly unreasonable. Even a “constrained ball-
and-socket joint,” as contrived by AdjustaCam, allows movement in multiple axes 
of rotation and is, therefore, outside the reach of the ’343 Patent’s claims. 
IV.
ADJUSTACAM’S VALIDITY ARGUMENTS
 
Adjustacam also took frivolous positions in distinguishing prior art, such as 
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. H2-19997 to Irifune (“Irifune”). This prior 
art discloses a camera rotatably attached to a hinge member (mounting device (2)) 
via the threaded “camera attachment shaft (9)”: 
A1386, A1387, A1394.  AdjustaCam’s expert took the indefensible position that 
Irifune does not disclose a device that can be rotatably attached to a camera.  
Specifically, Dr. Muskivitch reasoned that “[w]ith Irifune, the camera is not even 
attached to the hinge member until fully tightened down using camera attachment 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 160 of 242   Page ID #:160
18
shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and (11).” A1263.  Using an 
exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” (“permanently fixed joined, 
connected, or bound”), Dr. Muskivitch opined that Irifune did not meet the claim 
requirements because “[o]nce the camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera 
cannot rotate about a first axis relative to the hinge member.”  Id.   Put another 
way, in Dr. Muskivitch’s view, when the camera of Irifune is screwed all the way 
onto the hinge member, the camera cannot be rotated, and if the camera is loosened 
to permit rotation, the camera is not attached.  Id. (“[E]ven assuming for the sake 
of argument that with Irifune the camera is attached, it is not “rotatably attached.”). 
As early as August 12, 2011, in a reexamination proceeding regarding the 
’343 Patent, the USPTO rejected the asserted claims as anticipated and/or obvious 
based on Irifune.  A1425; A1431-36; A1376-96 (English translation of Irifune).  
Like Dr. Muskivitch later did in the litigation, during the reexamination 
proceedings patent owner Global-Media argued that the camera of Irifune is not 
“rotatably attached” to the hinge member because the camera “is not attached to 
the hinge member until fully screwed or threaded to the hinge member.” A1448.  
To make such an argument, Global-Media posited that the plain and ordinary 
meaning of attached is “permanently fixed, joined, connected, or bound.” A1447. 
The examiner rejected this argument twice, correctly concluding that “it is clearly 
possible to loosen the attachment screw, to enable the pivoting of the camera 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 161 of 242   Page ID #:161
19
relative to support (fixed part 2) while the camera is still attached to the support.” 
A1508-10; A1476.  After the third rejection based on Irifune, Global-Media 
cancelled all the asserted claims on September 20, 2012.  A1515-19, A1460, 
A1465, A1469-74, A1493, A1502-06. 
V.
ADJUSTACAM’S NUISANCE-VALUE SETTLEMENTS AND DEMANDS
 
Newegg, like its co-defendants, was served with a lawsuit and then 
approached by AdjustaCam to discuss settlement of the case.  Nearly every 
defendant proceeded to settle for a dollar amount well under the cost to defend 
oneself against the infringement allegations, most for less than [[
]].  A1282 
(AdjustaCam settlement agreement summary). 
 
Just two months after filing this lawsuit in July 2010, AdjustaCam executed 
its first nuisance-value settlement with defendant Trippe Manufacturing in the 
amount of [[
]].  A2182.  Soon thereafter, AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Klip Extreme, LLC and Software Brokers of America (D/B/A 
Intcomex) for [[
]], and a few months later AdjustaCam settled with 
defendants Phoebe Micro and jWIN for [[
]] and [[
]], respectively. 
Id.  By the time AdjustaCam dismissed Newegg in 2012, AdjustaCam had settled 
with at least:
• Twelve defendants for [[
]] or less;  
• Three defendants for an amount between [[
]];  
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 162 of 242   Page ID #:162
20
• Five defendants for an amount between [[
]]; and
• Two defendants for an amount between [[
]].
A1282.  All of the payments made by the various defendants are facially a small 
fraction of the cost of defense of a patent infringement lawsuit.
 
None of the settlement payments have any demonstrable tie to the 
defendants’ potential exposure in the litigation.  Yet AdjustaCam and its damages 
expert maintained that AdjustaCam’s settlement agreements (and demands) were 
based on an established target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit. See A1195-97 (“In its 
licensing program for this litigation, AdjustaCam used this $1.25 - $1.50 per 
webcam royalty rate as a baseline for licensing the various defendants.”); A1324 
(“[T]he 14 lump-sum settlements were based on negotiations targeting a royalty of 
$1.25 to $1.50.”); A1327-30.  This assertion has no support in the record. For 
example, looking at the units sold by AdjustaCam’s licensees, the effective royalty 
rate for 15 of the lump-sum settlement ranged from a minimum of [[
]] to 
a maximum of [[
]], with scattered data points in between: 
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 163 of 242   Page ID #:163
21
A1283-85.  Of those 15 settlements, not a single agreement included an effective 
royalty rate between $1.25 and $1.50 per unit for the defendant’s known past sales 
figures. Id. Few were even close. 
The alleged basis for the target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit was two 
settlement and license agreements entered into in 20015 by one of AdjustaCam’s 
predecessors in interest, PAR Technologies, both of which included lump sum 
payments plus prospective running royalty components.  A1197; A1282; A1303-
06.  One of these agreements had a tiered prospective royalty structure ranging 
from [[
]] per unit as the number of units increased, and the other had 
a royalty structure of [[
]] per unit that decreased to [[
]] as the sales 
5 The PAR Technologies agreements were therefore dated five years prior to the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case.  See A0540 (indicating that the 
hypothetical negotiation date in this case was 2006).

volume increased.  A0542-45; A0631.  From these two PAR Technologies 
agreements alone, to the exclusion of the more than a dozen other licenses that do 
not support the proffered royalty rage, and without making any comparison of the 
PAR Technologies licenses to the facts of the case against Newegg, AdjustaCam 
and its expert took the position that “a royalty in the $1.25 to $1.50 frame” was an 
appropriate and consistent target for licensing discussions.  A1305-06. 
Moreover, this supposed “target” royalty was essentially fixed in 
AdjustaCam’s view, as it was determined with no regard for price of the accused 
products sold by the defendants, the cost of the patented clip feature in the accused 
products, or even the number of units sold.  A1309-10 (characterizing $1.25 to 
$1.50 as the “intrinsic value of the patented feature” regardless of the sales price); 
A1311-12 (stating that the manufacturing cost of the patented camera clip is “not 
relevant” because “licensees have uniformly agreed to pay in the range of $1.25 to 
$1.50 per unit”); A1329-30 (explaining that a substantial increase in sales 
“wouldn’t affect my analysis because the target had always been in the range of 
$1.25 to $1.50”). 
AdjustaCam also tried to paint its target royalty as an established royalty.  
A1201 (“AdjustaCam’s settlement numbers were tied to a pre-established unit 
royalty of $1.25 - $1.50 per infringing device.”).  But AdjustaCam falls far short of 
the high standard for proving and established royalty because AdjustaCam did not 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 165 of 242   Page ID #:165
23
show that the PAR Technologies licenses were of sufficient number and frequency 
“to establish a regular price for a license” and “reflect a general acquiescence in 
[the price’s] reasonableness,” that the royalty-establishing licenses were not 
settlements of threatened or actual litigation, and that the circumstances and rights 
of the licenses are comparable to those in the present lawsuit. See, e.g., Rude v. 
Westcott, 130 U.S. 152, 165 (1889); Hanson v. Alpine Valley Ski Area, Inc., 718 
F.2d 1075, 1078 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  None of these factors are met in this case—the 
two PAR Technologies licenses were both settlements of litigation and neither was 
shown by AdjustaCam to be in any way comparable to the dispute between 
AdjustaCam and Newegg other than the fact that both involve the ’343 Patent.  
A1196; A0631.
In attempt to manufacture some credibility for its “target royalty,” six of 
AdjustaCam’s litigation settlement agreements were drafted to include [[
]].  A0545-49.  This self-serving provision was included by AdjustaCam 
knowing full well that none of those six defendants would sell enough products to 
ever pay a running royalty during the term of the patent.  A0558 (AdjustaCam’s 
expert stating “I understand that AdjustaCam utilized this royalty structure because 
these licensees had a low volume of past sales it would be highly unlikely that total

Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 166 of 242   Page ID #:166
24
volume sales would exceed the units included in the lump-sum payment”); A1313-
14 (AdjustaCam’s expert admitting that none of the six licensees ever reached the 
maximum number of sales and had to pay a running royalty).  Conveniently, 
AdjustaCam set the meaninglessly high number of units threshold, when divided 
by the lump sum payment, to equate to an effective royalty for past sales of 
[[
]].  A0631-33.  In reality, the parties to those six 
agreements, like every other settling defendant, paid nuisance value (between 
[[
]]) to settle with AdjustaCam.  A631-33.  This effort by 
AdjustaCam to conceal the true nature of its agreements evidences its deceptive 
intent and bad faith. 
Thus, all of AdjustaCam’s settlement licenses in reality reflect a nuisance-
value lump sum payment, and AdjustaCam has no evidence that it ever approached 
any negotiations with an intention to obtain its alleged target royalty.  Indeed, 
AdjustaCam’s 30(b)(6) representative could not even verify that it was, at any 
time, aware of the number of units sold by any of the defendants with which it 
settled.  A1337-38.  Such information certainly does not appear in AdjustaCam’s 
expert’s report.
AdjustaCam also made multiple settlement offers to Newegg that reflect a 
nuisance value and were untied to Newegg’s sales of the accused cameras.  By the 
time of a November 9, 2011 mediation, Newegg had confirmed sales of 14,499 
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 167 of 242   Page ID #:167
25
units of the accused Rosewill products for total revenues of $63,760 and sales of 
5,904 units of other accused products—the majority of which were supplied to 
Newegg by other named defendants—for total revenues of $33,379.  A1784; 
A1226; A1362-63.  Despite claiming entitlement to a minimum per-unit royalty 
between $1.25 and $1.50, AdjustaCam demanded $75,000—nearly three times its
“target” per-unit royalty and more than 75% of Newegg’s total revenue from sales 
of the accused products.  A1226; A1362-63. 
After mediation and before eventually dismissing Newegg, AdjustaCam 
made two additional nuisance-value settlement demands. In March 2012, after 
many of the accused Newegg products had been the subject of settlements between 
AdjustaCam and Newegg’s suppliers, AdjustaCam demanded $65,000 to settle the 
case. A1227.  Then, on July 11, 2012, less than two weeks after serving a report 
from its damages expert, AdjustaCam demanded more than $50,000 to settle.  
A1227; A1365.  This reduced demand was still nearly three times the amount 
calculated by AdjustaCam’s own expert.  A1244-45 (calculating damages as to 
Newegg at $17,928—i.e., $1.25 x 14,342 units).  In fact, AdjustaCam’s expert 
admitted that this final demand, effectively more than $3.50 per unit, would be 
decidedly unreasonable.  A1331 (“Q. Do you believe a per-unit royalty for 
Newegg of $3 or more than $3 would be reasonable?  A. No.”).

26
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 
AdjustaCam sued Newegg and dozens of other targets for the improper 
purpose of seeking nuisance-value settlement payments.  This patent lawsuit had 
nothing to do with any bona fide complaint of infringement.  Newegg should be 
reimbursed for its expenses contesting this meritless case. 
Every agreement AdjustaCam obtained for its patent was for a dollar amount 
constituting a small fraction of the cost of defense, the majority for [[
]] or 
less, and always as a round number.  Yet AdjustaCam desperately twisted this 
nuisance-value evidence in attempt to justify an unsupportable $1.25 per unit 
royalty demand—a supposed “target royalty” that never really existed and was 
never used as a target by anybody in settlement discussions.  In truth, the 
defendants universally paid off AdjustaCam because it was far cheaper than 
defending themselves, just as AdjustaCam intended. 
Newegg refused to pay to make this case go away because AdjustaCam was 
abusively accusing products that did not, and could not, infringe the patent-in-suit, 
and was merely using the high cost of litigation defense to leverage nuisance 
settlements.  For justice to be done, somebody had to challenge AdjustaCam’s 
baseless case and extortive patent litigation practices.  Newegg accepted the task, 
and took on the expense of defending against AdjustaCam’s nuisance litigation 
campaign.

 AdjustaCam’s patent covers a camera that is claimed to rotate in a single 
axis of rotation.  But it is undisputed that AdjustaCam accused products having 
ball-and-socket joints such that, by definition, the cameras can be rotated about 
multiple axes of rotation.  This impossibility of infringement was apparent when 
the lawsuit was filed, but AdjustaCam pursued the case anyway because proving 
infringement was never the point of this lawsuit.
 
Even after the district court construed the claims decisively foreclosing 
AdjustaCam’s effort to avoid the single-axis-of-rotation claim requirement, 
AdjustaCam pressed on undeterred as long as Newegg refused to accept 
AdjustaCam’s many nuisance-value settlement offers.  Clearly AdjustaCam 
assumed that eventually Newegg would take the easy way out and just pay to make 
this case go away, but AdjustaCam was wrong.  
 
After extensive and burdensome expert discovery solidified the long-known 
and fatal shortcomings of AdjustaCam’s case, AdjustaCam simply walked away.  
Finally conceding that its shakedown efforts against Newegg were futile and that 
its infringement case was doomed, AdjustaCam dismissed its case with prejudice, 
thus avoiding having to back up its allegations in court and put its patent in 
jeopardy.
To make matters worse, all Newegg’s time and money (totaling more than 
$350,000 in attorneys’ fees and expert fees at the time of Newegg’s fee motion, 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 170 of 242   Page ID #:170
28
plus the considerable additional expenses of this appeal) was wasted on defending 
this frivolous lawsuit even though AdjustaCam knew for nearly a year before 
Newegg was dismissed that Newegg’s potential exposure was truly de minimis.  
Newegg initially confirmed accused sales of less than $100,000, and that figure 
decreased over time as AdjustaCam’ licensed Newegg’s suppliers to a figure less 
than $20,000. 
Unlike its many of co-defendants who settled with AdjustaCam and further 
funded AdjustaCam’s nuisance litigation campaign against remaining defendants, 
Newegg took the expensive path and defended against the baseless and bad faith 
infringement assertions.  Companies that are willing to help weed out bad actors by 
challenging their frivolous patent assertions should not be left to bear their 
litigation expenses without some reasonable and fair prospect of being made whole 
for having to endure such injustice.  The protection of Section 285 is a critical 
safeguard to protect the system against the type of cynical, nuisance patent 
litigation that has given patents a bad name in some quarters.   The business model 
of using meritless patent claims to extract nuisance payments from a broad cross-
section of small businesses is, by design, normally kept out of this Court’s view.   
Without a faithful application of fee shifting in this type of case, the sharp practices 
on display here will stay in the shadows rather than being exposed in the 
disinfectant of the light.  And companies such as Newegg would have that much 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 171 of 242   Page ID #:171
29
less incentive to contest nuisance-settlement claims, even when fighting such 
claims appears to many to be economically irrational and distracting.   
Nuisance litigation like AdjustaCam’s cannot be encouraged, nor can it be 
immunized from fee-shifting merely because AdjustaCam eventually dismissed the 
case.  Although bad faith nuisance litigation is commonplace among today’s patent 
litigants, litigants are required to litigate in good faith.  Because AdjustaCam did 
not litigate in good faith, this case “stands out from the others” and is exceptional 
under Octane Fitness, and is also sufficiently egregious to warrant expert fee 
shifting.  This Court should declare as much and order the payment by 
AdjustaCam of Newegg’s recoverable fees. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
The denial of a motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion. Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 134 S. 
Ct. 1744, 1747 (2014) (“[A]n appellate court should review all aspects of a district 
court’s § 285 determination for abuse of discretion.”).
A district court’s decision not to award expert fees under its inherent 
authority is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 
“The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate court’s

ARGUMENT
I.
THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY NOT FINDING THIS
CASE EXCEPTIONAL AND EGREGIOUS
 
The Supreme Court in its recent Octane Fitness decision explained that, 
under the 35 U.S.C. § 285, “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out 
from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position 
(considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable 
manner in which the case was litigated.”  134 S. Ct. at 1756.  “District courts may 
determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-case exercise of their 
discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.”  Id.
While Section 285 allows for shifting of attorneys’ fees, for egregious cases, 
such as those involving an abuse of the judicial process, district courts also have 
the inherent authority to award expert fees.  MarcTec, 664 F.3d at 921 (explaining 
that district courts should exercise this inherent authority in cases involving fraud 
or bad faith where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”) (internal quotation 
marks omitted); Amsted Indus. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co., 23 F.3d 374, 378 
(Fed. Cir. 1994) (explaining that “abuse of the judicial process” justifies shifting 
expert fees).

As noted above, the district court decided Newegg’s motion before Octane
Fitness relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285.  In 
denying Newegg’s motion, the district court recited and applied the then-applicable 
law under Brooks Furniture Mfg. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. 
Cir. 2005), stating that absent material inappropriate conduct in litigation, “an 
exceptional case may only be found if ‘both (1) the litigation is brought in 
subjective bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively baseless.’”  A0005. 
Unlike under the Brooks Furniture standard relied on by the district court, 
the exceptionality standard now does not, for example, require proof of both 
objective baselessness and bad faith, require misconduct to be independently 
sanctionable, or require proof by clear and convincing evidence.  Octane Fitness,
134 S. Ct. at 1757-58.  Here, because the district court erred by denying Newegg’s 
motion under the strict Brooks Furniture standard, it certainly also erred under the 
far less burdensome Octane Fitness standard as well.   
In denying Newegg’s motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, the district 
court misapprehended the evidence and the parties’ contentions to reach a 
manifestly incorrect result.  Under either the Brooks Furniture or Octane Fitness 
analytical framework, this “clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence” 
constitutes an abuse of discretion. Highmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1748 n. 2.

A.
AdjustaCam Filed and Prosecuted This Case in Bad Faith 
According to the district court, “there is insufficient evidence that the action 
was brought in bad faith and for an improper purpose.”  A0006.  In fact, the 
evidence of bad faith was overwhelming. 
Not only did AdjustaCam pursue Newegg for two years on patent claims 
that were facially not infringed by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products, but it 
pressed on with its case even after the Markman Order emphatically precluded any 
possible relief for AdjustaCam.  See infra.  All the while, AdjustaCam made 
Newegg spend considerable sums of money on discovery—including extensive 
expert discovery—defending against these baseless allegations.  To make matters 
worse, all this time and money was wasted on a frivolous lawsuit even though 
AdjustaCam knew that Newegg’s potential exposure was minimal.  A1784; 
A1226; A1362-63. 
This bad faith behavior is easily understood when one looks at 
AdjustaCam’s purpose in bringing its lawsuits—to extract nuisance-value 
settlements.  Even the district court conceded that “the smaller settlements suggest 
this case was a settlement driven case.”  A0007.  The merits of the cases had 
nothing to do with the filing and maintenance of the lawsuits.  As long as 
AdjustaCam could convince its target defendants that it was cheaper, and made 
more business sense, to pay a small sum of money to make the case go away than 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 175 of 242   Page ID #:175
33
to defend themselves, AdjustaCam would continue to collect its money without 
ever having to risk its patent and justify its positions in court.  But AdjustaCam did 
not count on Newegg defending itself, and had no choice but to dismiss Newegg if 
it wanted to preserve its shakedown business. 
1.
AdjustaCam Brought this Case for the Improper Purpose of 
Obtaining Nuisance-Value Settlements 
As explained above, the record shows that AdjustaCam’s settlement 
agreements are all for nuisance value.  See supra Statement of Facts, Part V.  The 
vast majority of Newegg’s co-defendants paid [[
]] or less to settle, more 
than half paying [[
]] or less, and always as a round number.  A1282. 
None of AdjustaCam’s post-hac efforts to align those nuisance-value 
agreements with its supposed damages calculations pass muster.  See supra 
Statement of Facts, Part V.  AdjustaCam’s fabrication of an unsupportable and 
unused “target” royalty (e.g., A1195-96), as well as its illusory and never-paid 
“running royalty” components of six of its settlements (A0545-49; A0558; A1313-
14; A0631-33), are no more than self-serving litigation-induced arguments.  In 
reality, the effective royalties paid by Newegg’s co-defendants were all over the 
map.  A1283-85 (effective royalties ranging from [[
]] per unit).  
Not even the two supposedly “foundational” PAR Technologies license 
agreements support a “target” (and, essentially, fixed) royalty of $1.25 to $1.50 per 
unit.  A0542-45 (discussing royalty ranges from [[
]]); A0631.

AdjustaCam’s settlements, as well as the settlement demands made to 
Newegg, are not reasonably tied to any prior comparable licenses or the potential 
infringement exposure of any party.  The settlement payments are merely round 
numbers set to encourage defendants not to fight the lawsuit on the merits due to 
the far greater expense involved in doing so.  District courts cannot be allowed to 
turn a blind eye to such flagrant bad faith.
As this Court has observed, “low settlement offers . . . effectively ensure[] 
that [the patentee’s] baseless infringement allegations remained unexposed, 
allowing [the patentee] to continue to collect additional nuisance value 
settlements.”  Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, 653 F.3d 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 
2011); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. York Int’l Corp., 244 F. Supp. 2d 990, 997 
(W.D. Wis. 2002) (Bad faith litigation tactics “force defendants into settlement and 
away from their legitimate defenses.”); Artese v. Academy Collection Service, No.
3:96-cv-2546-GLG, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186, at *10 (D. Conn. Jan. 18, 2000) 
(holding that the filing of many lawsuits seeking relatively small settlements “gives 
rise to a suspicion of barratry and champerty”).
Here, AdjustaCam’s settlement amounts are very small compared to the cost 
of defense, showing that AdjustaCam’s desire is to obtain nuisance settlement 
revenue rather than actually pursue meritorious claims in litigation.  When 
Newegg, after nearly two years, still refused to settle and remained determined to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 177 of 242   Page ID #:177
35
vindicate its legal positions, AdjustaCam’s response exposed its true purpose in 
suing Newegg.  Instead of trying to prove Newegg’s defenses wrong in court, 
AdjustaCam simply walked away from its case.  Such an “overall vexatious 
litigation strategy” that is wasteful of judicial resources evidences bad faith.  See
Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. v. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd., 726 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 
2013).
Belated timing of dismissal can also evidence bad faith and justify fee 
shifting.  In Monolithic Power Systems, the case was deemed exceptional in large 
part because the plaintiff “withdrew its claims and granted covenants not to sue 
after substantial litigation had taken place,” “moving to dismiss only after 
[defendants] had completed their filings for the final pretrial conference, wasting 
the parties’ and the court’s resources.”  Id.  Likewise, here AdjustaCam waited two 
years to dismiss Newegg, knowing that Newegg’s exposure was minimal, and did 
not actually dismiss Newegg until after Newegg had incurred considerable expense 
in attorney and expert fees.  AdjustaCam cannot just lose interest and walk away 
with zero consequences after forcing Newegg to spend more than $350,000 in 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees to defend itself up its fee motion.  A1793-94; 
A1239 (explaining that Newegg expended $286,102.52 in attorneys’ fees, plus 
$68,183.93 in expert fees through just September 2012).  To date, Newegg has 
been forced to spend more than $450,000 by AdjustaCam’s frivolous lawsuit, with 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 178 of 242   Page ID #:178
36
outstanding invoices of $60,000 at present, plus more by the time this appeal 
concludes.
In Ingenuity 13, LLC v. Doe, copyright plaintiffs were found to have acted in 
bad faith and sanctioned for fees in circumstances largely identical to those in this 
case.  No. 2:12-cv-8333-ODW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64564 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 
2013).  First, the plaintiffs engaged in a strategy to file lawsuits against many 
defendants.  Id. at *6-7.  Due to “the high cost of litigation,” “[m]ost defendants 
settled . . . , resulting in proceeds of millions of dollars due to the numerosity of 
defendants.” Id. “For defendants that refused to settle, the Principals engaged in 
vexatious litigation designed to coerce settlement. These lawsuits were filed using 
boilerplate complaints based on a modicum of evidence, calculated to maximize 
settlement profits by minimizing costs and effort.”  Importantly, like AdjustaCam, 
in Ingenuity 13 “[t]he Principals have shown little desire to proceed in these 
lawsuits when faced with a determined defendant.  Instead of litigating, they 
dismiss the case.”  Id. at *7.
Courts have acknowledged in various circumstances that it is fundamentally 
unfair for a plaintiff to force a defendant to endure substantial burden and expense 
in litigation and then lose interest and walk away from the case without any 
consequences.
See Colombrito v. Kelly, 764 F.2d 122, 134-35 (2d Cir. 1985) 
(noting that awarding fees would be appropriate “if a litigant had made a practice 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 179 of 242   Page ID #:179
37
of repeatedly bringing potentially meritorious claims and then dismissing them 
with prejudice after inflicting substantial litigation costs on the opposing party and 
 the judicial system”); Upthegrove v. Health Prof’ls, LTD., No. 07-cv-0596-BBC, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4546, at *12 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 21, 2009) (“Plaintiff cannot 
expect to subject defendant Rose to a year of litigation and walk away with no 
consequences.”); compare Monolithic Power Sys., 726 F.3d at 1367 (affirming 
award of fees, emphasizing that vexatious case was dismissed “after substantial 
litigation had taken place . . . wasting the parties’ and the court’s resources”). 
AdjustaCam professes that its desire was not to extort a nuisance-value 
settlement from Newegg.  According to AdjustaCam, its decision to dismiss 
Newegg was for “strategic reasons unrelated to the merits”—essentially, 
“winnowing out” Newegg due to its de minimis infringement in comparison with 
Sakar once other defendants were dismissed and some of Newegg’s sales became 
licensed.  A1192-93.  First, the timing of events, with the Markman Order 
triggering several small settlements in short order, does not bear out AdjustaCam’s 
position. See supra.  Second, AdjustaCam’s implying that it is perfectly acceptable 
to file and maintain lawsuits against “de minimis infringers” so long as it “winnows 
them out” and dismisses them before trial is deeply misguided.  Section 285’s 
exceptional case provision exists precisely to prevent such “gross injustice to an 
alleged infringer.” Mathis v. Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 180 of 242   Page ID #:180
38
AdjustaCam knew of Newegg’s minimal exposure long before Newegg was 
dismissed and, in fact, well before Newegg had to endure the burden and expense 
of the February 2012 Markman hearing and subsequent discovery, including 
considerable expert discovery.  A1784; A1226; A1362-63 (describing sales figures 
provided to AdjustaCam at least as early as November 2011); A2136 (August 2012 
dismissal motion).  Shackling Newegg with considerable and unjustifiable 
litigation costs, despite Newegg’s minimal exposure, is exceptional and abusive. 
2.
Nuisance Litigation is Exceptional and Egregious 
It is no secret that nuisance litigation brought by patent assertion entities is 
now fairly common and has become its own lucrative industry.  See, e.g., Colleen
V. Chien, Patent Trolls by the Numbers, Santa Clara University Studies Research 
Paper No. 08-13, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2233041 (March 13, 2013) 
(explaining that patent assertion entities file the majority patent lawsuits in the 
U.S., primarily targeting non-technology companies). 
It would be clear error and an abuse of discretion, however, for the district 
court to conclude from this state of affairs that such litigation misconduct is not 
“exceptional” within the meaning of Section 285.  Octane Fitness explained that 
“an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out from others” regarding weak 
merits positions or litigation misconduct.  134 S. Ct. at 1756.  But the Court 
certainly did not suggest, let alone hold, that courts should allow themselves to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 181 of 242   Page ID #:181
39
become desensitized to bad faith nuisance litigation just because it is 
commonplace.  Such a conclusion contradicts the plain purpose of Section 285, as 
well as basic fairness and common sense. 
Section 285 is supposed to be remedial—to correct for unfairness and 
injustice in a flexible, fact-specific manner.  See Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 
1753, 1756 n.6; see also Kilopass Tech., Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302,  
1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court was so cynical 
as to assume that patent litigation ordinarily involves bad faith and misconduct.  
The obvious assumption and requirement of Section 285 is that patent litigation 
will be brought and conducted in good faith, and that a case is “exceptional” when 
it sufficiently deviates from this expectation of litigants.  Cf. Medtronic 
Navigation, Inc. v. BrainLAB Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH, 603 F.3d 
943, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“[T]here is a presumption that an assertion of 
infringement of a duly granted patent is made in good faith.”). 
Moreover, using the court system to further AdjustaCam’s extortive business 
practices is exactly the kind of egregious bad faith and abuse of the judiciary that 
warrants shifting of expert fees.  MarcTec, 664 F.3d 907 at 921.  Bad faith 
assertions of frivolous lawsuits unreasonably burden the litigation targets and the 
courts.  Awarding expert fees is necessary where a plaintiff’s vexatious misconduct 
forces a defendant to incur those expert fees unnecessarily, as those fees are not 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 182 of 242   Page ID #:182
40
compensable under Section 285.  Id. at 921-22 (holding that expert fees were 
properly awarded because “Cordis was forced to incur expert witness expenses to 
rebut MarcTec’s unreliable and irrelevant expert testimony,” such that “MarcTec’s 
vexatious conduct and bad faith increased  the cost of litigation in ways that are not 
compensated under § 285”).  Here, as in MarcTec, AdjustaCam’s experts’ 
testimony was fatally flawed and could not possibly have proven infringement or 
AdjustaCam’s alleged damages.  AdjustaCam only proceeded into expert 
discovery to apply more pressure to Newegg for a nuisance-value settlement.  For 
Newegg to have to spend huge sums of money on experts to rebut AdjustaCam’s 
experts’ baseless allegations, on top of all the other misconduct and expense 
inflicted by AdjustaCam in seeking nuisance-value settlements, is a grave injustice 
that cannot be permitted.  Id. at 921 (inherent authority should be exercised to shift 
expert fees where “the very temple of justice has been defiled”).
Patent litigation is supposed to resolve legitimate disputes surrounding bona 
fide infringement allegations, not facilitate nuisance-value patent monetization 
campaigns.  See Eon-Net, 653 F.3d at 1328 (“[T]he appetite for licensing revenue 
cannot overpower a litigant’s and its counsel’s obligation to file cases reasonably 
based in law and fact and to litigate those cases in good faith.”).  This Court should 
take this opportunity to clarify that litigation brought for the purposes of extorting 
nuisance-value settlements is exceptional and will not be tolerated or immunized 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 183 of 242   Page ID #:183
41
from fee-shifting simply because it is widespread.  And to the extent a nuisance 
litigation campaign crosses into the expert discovery phase of a case, those expert 
expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
District courts cannot be allowed to make the presumption of good faith 
litigation unrebuttable by turning a blind eye to clear evidence of bad faith.  Here, 
the district court appears to have looked the other way and thereby abused its 
discretion in multiple ways. 
3.
Nuisance Litigation Should be Strongly Discouraged 
Section 285 and Octane Fitness recognize that the specter of fee-shifting is 
intended to have a deterrent effect on bad faith litigation and misconduct.  134 S. 
Ct. at 1756 n.6 (reminding district courts of “the need in particular circumstances 
to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence”).  That purpose would 
be frustrated if all one had to do to avoid any possible fee-shifting is dismiss its 
case and avoid losing on the merits.  AdjustaCam cannot avoid the expensive and 
wasteful consequences of its extortion tactics simply because it dismissed Newegg 
from the case.  See Kilopass, 738 F.3d at 1317 (“[T]rial courts retain broad 
discretion to make findings of exceptionality under § 285 in a wide variety of 
circumstances.”).   
To be clear, a plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of a meritless case should be 
encouraged at the earliest juncture.  But when a case is brought for reasons 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 184 of 242   Page ID #:184
42
unrelated to the merits and to obtain nuisance-value settlements, as it was here, the 
incentive to dismiss must also include an incentive to dismiss at a meaningful 
time—i.e., before substantial expense and burden is inflicted on the defendant.  
This Court should clarify that Section 285 provides those incentives, and that such 
plaintiffs who pursue such cases for too long before dismissing will be viewed as 
acting in bad faith and will be ordered to pay a defendant’s attorneys’ fees.  Again, 
to the extent a nuisance litigation campaign crosses into the expert phase of a case, 
those expert fees and expenses should not have to be borne by the defendants. 
Using the United States judiciary to leverage nuisance-value settlements also 
reflects selfish opportunism and unreasonably burdens the courts.  See Artese, 2000 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 at *10-11 (“[I]t is not merely the prejudice and costs to the 
opposing party but also the effect upon the judicial system of such litigation. When 
we consider the numerous other cases commenced by this plaintiff . . . there has 
been indeed a substantial burden on the judicial system.”).  Behavior that treats the 
judiciary as a pawn for nuisance-value settlement negotiations and makes courts 
waste considerable time and resources should be strongly discouraged.
By contrast, defendants like Newegg, who do not pay a patentee in a 
nuisance litigation simply to make a lawsuit go away, play an important role in the 
patent system.  Such defendants insist that plaintiffs justify their positions and, 
when the plaintiffs cannot or will not do so, will vindicate their defenses in court.  
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 185 of 242   Page ID #:185
43
If not for defendants like Newegg, abusive nuisance litigants would never be 
exposed because every case would settle (or be unilaterally dismissed by the 
plaintiffs) and conceal the misconduct.  Section 285 should serve as a meaningful 
deterrent to patent abuses like those present in this case.  Newegg and other 
similarly-situated defendants should not be discouraged from taking the more 
onerous course of defending themselves to help discourage abusive patent 
assertions.
Absent a meaningful fee-shifting standard where fees are reasonably 
attainable, defendants are more likely to simply settle nuisance litigations because 
the financial downsides of mounting a strong defense are overwhelming.  If 
AdjustaCam’s conduct is not deemed exceptional and egregious in this case, it will 
embolden nuisance litigants to continue their abusive conduct unchecked.
When the Supreme Court issued its Octane Fitness and Highmark decisions
on the same day, notwithstanding the adoption of an abuse-of-discretion standard 
for appellate review in Highmark, the decisions collectively reflected a clear 
directive from the Supreme Court that fee shifting was supposed to be made easier 
to achieve, not harder.  See, e.g., Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756 (characterizing 
the Brooks Furniture standard as “inflexible”; id. at 1756-57 (explaining that 
misconduct to justify fee-shifting need not be independently sanctionable); id. at 
1758 (noting that the burden of proof for exceptionality is merely a preponderance 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 186 of 242   Page ID #:186
44
of the evidence, not clear and convincing).  This Court has the power to police the 
district courts in their exercises of discretion, and the Supreme Court undoubtedly 
intended that reviewing courts would step in to ensure that Section 285 was 
administered in a fair and just manner. See Highmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1748 n. 2 (“The 
abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate court’s correction of a 
district court’s legal or factual error: ‘A district court would necessarily abuse its 
discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly 
erroneous assessment of the evidence.’”) (quoting Cooter, 496 U.S. at 405). 
B.
The Accused Cameras Could Not Possibly Have Infringed 
The district court agreed with AdjustaCam that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included constrained ball-and-socket joints that restricted movement to 
some extent.  A0006. According to the district court, this constricted movement 
made it possible for AdjustaCam to prevail in proving infringement: 
[i]f the ball and socket joint truly restricts the range of movement 
such that it cannot rotate about multiple axes, the constrained ball and 
socket joint could meet the claim limitation which requires the hinge 
member being rotatably attached to the camera in a single axis of 
rotation.  Since one could reasonably argue Defendants’ products 
meet the “rotatably attached” limitation, AdjustaCam’s infringement 
theories are not objectively baseless. 
A0006.  The problem is that the above-emphasized portion—the premise and sine 
qua non of the district court’s conclusion—is not true and does not even reflect 
AdjustaCam’s position.  It is undisputed that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 187 of 242   Page ID #:187
45
Products included cameras that were in fact capable of rotating about multiple axes 
with respect to the socket—they could be both twisted and tilted up and down. 
AdjustaCam never argued that the constrained ball-and-socket joints were 
incapable of rotating about multiple axes—it merely posited that the different 
rotations were “separate.”  A0482-83 (“[I]f I rotate it around to the center, there is 
nothing that forces it to move, to tilt or to sway to either side.”); A0484 (“There is 
two axes, but they are separate.”); A0485-87 (“This happens to be a constrained 
ball and socket joint.  So it can [1] spin about the axis, it can [2] move forward, it 
may be able to [3] move to the side.”).
On this record, there is no question that the cameras of the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Products were capable of rotating in at least two different and distinct 
directions with respect to the sockets, not merely rotating about the claimed and 
singular “first axis of rotation.”  ’343 Patent, Claim 1 (“said camera, when the 
hinge member is so attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said 
hinge member”).  It was objectively baseless for AdjustaCam to contend that such 
cameras were “limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  One could not 
reasonably argue otherwise. 
Importantly, AdjustaCam was not advancing a theory of infringement under 
the doctrine of equivalents, and so its case hinged on proof of literal infringement.
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 188 of 242   Page ID #:188
46
See, e.g., A0996-97 and A1160-61 (AdjustaCam’s expert report presenting only 
direct, literal infringement theory).
Long before the district court’s Markman
Order formally doomed 
AdjustaCam’s case, the plain language of the claims, and especially in light of the 
specification, made clear that the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products could not 
possibly infringe.  A0022 (“The claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ 
object as rotating about a single axis.”); A0021 (“Every reference to a ‘rotatably 
attached’ object in the specification and claims describes the attachment as 
permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).  From the outset of this lawsuit, 
no reasonable plaintiff could have expected to succeed in proving infringement. 
The situation would be somewhat different if AdjustaCam honestly did not 
know that infringement was impossible to prove at the outset of the case, but later 
discovered that it could not prevail.  Here, such ignorance is implausible given the 
readily apparent functionality of the accused products and the simplicity of the 
patent and its claims.  But even if AdjustaCam could legitimately plead ignorance, 
ignorance is no excuse to continue undeterred—for nearly five months, which 
included considerable and expensive expert discovery—after the district court’s 
decisive Markman ruling in Newegg’s favor.  A0013-27 (April 10, 2012 Markman
Order); A2141 (August 27, 2012 motion to dismiss Newegg).  Here, as in 
MarcTec, AdjustaCam “not only initiated a frivolous lawsuit, it persisted in 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 189 of 242   Page ID #:189
47
advancing unfounded arguments that unnecessarily extended this litigation and 
caused [defendant] to incur needleless litigation expenses. This vexatious conduct 
is, by definition, litigation misconduct, and provides a separate and independent 
basis supporting the district court’s determination that this case is exceptional.”  
MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d at 920-21 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
C.
AdjustaCam’s Validity Positions Were Frivolous 
As explained above, AdjustaCam advanced the following frivolous 
argument in response to the clear anticipation of its claims by Irifune: “With 
Irifune, the camera is not even attached to the hinge member until fully tightened 
down using camera attachment shaft (9) and camera attachment screws (10 and 
(11).” A1263.  Using the exceedingly narrow definition of “attached” offered in 
the reexamination, AdjustaCam’s expert Dr. Muskivitch opined that, “[o]nce the 
camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera cannot rotate about a first axis 
relative to the hinge member.”  Id.
These concocted arguments were objectively baseless for several reasons.  
First, AdjustaCam’s illogical attempt to narrow the meaning of “rotatably 
attached” contradicts the claim language and the specification of the ’343 Patent.  
If the camera disclosed in the ’343 Patent was “permanently fixed to,” or had to be 
fully tightened down to the hinge member, then the camera could not rotate about 
the first axis of rotation as the claims and specification require.  Indeed, such 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 190 of 242   Page ID #:190
48
arguments contradict AdjustaCam’s own proposed construction of “rotatably 
attached” in this litigation (“connected such that the connected object is capable of 
being rotated”).  A2813-14.  The Irifune camera is certainly “capable of being 
rotated”—e.g., when it is partially unscrewed from the threaded camera attachment 
shaft on the hinge.  AdjustaCam’s argument that a camera is not rotatably attached 
to a hinge member unless it is “permanently fixed to” or fully tightened down to 
the hinge member also contradicts the district court’s Markman Order because 
such a camera would not be capable of rotation about any axis.  A0021 (“Every 
reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ object in the specification and claims describes 
the attachment as permitting motion over a single axis of rotation.”).   AdjustaCam 
could not reasonably expect to prevail against Newegg’s invalidity arguments 
based on Irifune. 
D.
The District Court’s Actions Cumulatively Reveal Its Abuse              
Of Discretion 
District courts cannot look the other way when there is clear evidence of bad 
faith litigation misconduct.  Here, the district court appears to have done just that, 
and thereby abused its discretion.  This is evident by several rulings—and absence 
of rulings—in the waning months of the case after AdjustaCam abandoned its 
unsustainable patent infringement case. 
First, there is no doubt that patent litigation is expensive, and the courts have 
set up a system whereby prevailing parties may recover their costs.  In this case, 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 191 of 242   Page ID #:191
49
not only did Newegg prevail when AdjustaCam gave up in the litigation, but 
Newegg also got AdjustaCam to not oppose its application for $8,492.66 in costs.  
Despite the unopposed nature of Newegg’s bill of costs, the district court did not 
award them, instead and without explanation providing that each party is to bear its 
own costs.  A0199-200, A0001-03. 
Second, Newegg gave the district court the opportunity to correct this error 
in awarding costs, immediately moving to correct the erroneous judgment.  But the 
district court sat on Newegg’s motion for six months, not ruling on it even though 
the failure to give Newegg its costs was plainly in error and easily fixable as a 
clerical matter.  This had the effect of causing this Court to deactivate the appeal of 
the denial of attorneys’ fees, and after an extensive delay, Newegg was forced to 
withdraw its motion to avoid further delay of this appeal. 
Third, as explained herein, the district court refused to grant attorneys’ fees 
under 35 U.S.C. § 285, ignoring that AdjustaCam’s claim construction position 
was never reasonable, ignoring that AdjustaCam’s post-claim construction 
infringement position was egregious, and ignoring the length of time that 
AdjustaCam pursued its case without any valid basis. 
Finally, the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award to 
Newegg its expert fees, under its inherent authority, despite the fact that Newegg 
had to spend significant amounts on expert fees solely because AdjustaCam sought 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 192 of 242   Page ID #:192
50
to promulgate a frivolous infringement position—a position resting solely on the 
testimony of an expert who ignored the Court’s claim construction and the realities 
of the accused products, thus forcing Newegg to counter with its own experts. 
Patent litigation is expensive, and the cumulative effect of the district court’s 
decisions (or lack thereof) was to force Newegg to spend money on patent 
litigation it could have been spending on its customers or employees.  This Court 
has the power to explain that when a party consistently pushes unsupportable 
positions, it should have to pay attorneys’ fees.  See I.A.-I.C., supra.  But this 
Court also has the power to set forth that when a district court fails to provide 
appropriate relief in a series of rulings or lack of rulings, that is an abuse of 
discretion that must be rectified.  See Seismograph Svc. Corp. v. Offshore Ray-
Dist, Inc., 263 F.2d 5, 24 (5th Cir. 1958) (finding an abuse of discretion in failing 
to award attorneys’ fees under Section 285 where the district court was “too 
charitable to Seismograph in not so holding” that the litigation was “so vexatious 
and unjustified as to constitute an ‘exceptional case’”).  Even if none of the district 
court’s individual actions is enough to trigger the abuse of discretion alarm, 
certainly the cumulative effect of the district court’s actions requires this Court to 
intervene and award to Newegg its fees, costs, and expert costs.  It is vital to the 
judicial system that there be some meaningful and predictable boundaries for 
permissible litigation behavior, and the rules proffered by Newegg in this case help 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 193 of 242   Page ID #:193
51
promote impartiality in fee cases, which instills confidence in the public that 
everyone will be treated fairly and made whole when the system has been abused. 
II.
ADJUSTACAM’S APPEAL MUST BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF SUBJECT
MATTER JURISDICTION
Consistent with AdjustaCam’s bad faith overreaching and indifference to the 
merits of this litigation, AdjustaCam brought its own affirmative appeal to this 
Court where subject matter jurisdiction is indisputably lacking.  There is no legal 
support whatsoever for AdjustaCam’s attempt to appeal a claim construction issue 
that it lost in the district court, made no effort to preserve for appeal, and expressly 
extinguished when it dismissed its case against Newegg with prejudice. This 
frivolous appeal only compounds the exceptionality of this case and causes 
Newegg to incur further needless legal expenses. 
An “actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at 
the time the complaint was filed.”  Benitec Austl, Ltd. v. Nucleonics, Inc., 495 F.3d 
1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 
(1974)).  “Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold requirement for a court’s power 
to exercise jurisdiction over a case, and no amount of ‘prudential reasons’ or 
perceived increases in efficiency, however sound, can empower a federal court to 
hear a case where there is no extant case or controversy.”  Dow Jones & Co., Inc. 
v. Ablaise Ltd., 606 F.3d 1338, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 194 of 242   Page ID #:194
52
AdjustaCam filed its notice of appeal seeking review of the district court’s 
claim construction rulings.  A0193.  But by that time, Newegg had already been 
dismissed with prejudice from the case and given a covenant not to be sued in the 
future for infringement of the ’343 Patent.  A2136-37; A1986-87; A0155.  The 
dismissal and covenant extinguished any ongoing disputes between AdjustaCam 
and Newegg concerning the infringement and validity of the ’343 Patent.  Indeed, 
when dismissing Newegg, AdjustaCam even argued that its covenant divested the 
district court of subject matter jurisdiction over Newegg’s declaratory judgment 
counterclaims, citing Dow Jones, 606 F.3d at 1348 and Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. 
Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  A2136-37.  If there 
is no jurisdiction over Newegg’s non-infringement and invalidity counterclaims 
due to a lack of an ongoing controversy, certainly there can be no jurisdiction over 
AdjustaCam’s underlying infringement claims that were dismissed with prejudice. 
This Court has often recognized its inability to reach claim construction 
issues that are not subject to an ongoing case or controversy. See, e.g, SanDisk 
Corp. v. Kingston Tech. Co., 695 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[W]here, as 
here, a party’s claim construction arguments do not affect the final judgment 
entered by the court, they are not reviewable. . . . Without a final judgment as to 
the infringement or validity of these claims, the court’s claim constructions that 
impact only these withdrawn claims are not properly before us.”); Jang v. Boston 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 195 of 242   Page ID #:195
53
Sci. Corp., 532 F.3d 1330, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (resolving claim construction 
issues “that do not actually affect the infringement controversy between the 
parties” would result in impermissible advisory opinion because “[t]he Supreme 
Court has explicitly held that Article III does not permit the courts to resolve issues 
when it is not clear that the resolution of the question will resolve a concrete 
controversy between interested parties”); see also NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, 
Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 
Although AdjustaCam purports to appeal from the district court’s final 
judgment, because that final judgment was in no way based on the claim 
construction ruling, but was instead based entirely on the unopposed decision by 
AdjustaCam to affirmatively end the case, this Court lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction to review the claim constructions.
This is not a case where the parties consented to a judgment of non-
infringement based on the claim constructions to allow for appeal of the 
construction. See, e.g., SanDisk, 695 F.3d at 1353 (“SanDisk voluntarily withdrew 
the ’893 and ’808 patents and claims 1 and 10 of the ’842 patent from this action, 
and it does not dispute that the district court never entered a stipulated judgment of 
non-infringement with respect to these claims. Thus, these claims do not present a 
current infringement controversy before this court.”).  Here, AdjustaCam made no 
effort whatsoever to preserve any challenges to the district court’s claim 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 196 of 242   Page ID #:196
54
constructions when it decided to dismiss its case against Newegg.  Even in 
defending AdjustaCam’s litigation positions and opposing Newegg’s motion for 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, AdjustaCam noted no disagreement with the 
district court’s claim constructions.  A1191-94; A1194 (arguing that 
“AdjustaCam’s infringement positions are entirely consistent with the Court’s 
construction”).
This Court cannot hear AdjustaCam’s appeal because it lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction over the challenges raised to the claim construction rulings by the 
district court.  AdjustaCam’s appeal must be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be 
reversed, this case should be declared exceptional and egregious, and the case 
should be remanded to the district court to order payment by AdjustaCam of the 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees owed to Newegg.
 
Additionally, AdjustaCam’s appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT 
 
Sakar’s Cross-Appeal: 
The district court had original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1338(a).  Sakar filed a timely and proper notice of appeal under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4.  This Court has appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). 
AdjustaCam’s Appeal: 
For reasons discussed below, this Court does not have subject matter 
jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s appeal and AdjustaCam’s appeal must be 
dismissed. 
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES 
 
 
1. 
Whether the district court erred by failing to find this case exceptional 
and egregious under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and its inherent authority to award Sakar its 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, despite clear and unrebutted evidence showing that 
this lawsuit was meritless, was prosecuted in bad faith, and was prosecuted to 
leverage the high cost and burden of litigation to coerce a nuisance-value 
settlement payment from Sakar. 
 
2. 
Whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over AdjustaCam’s 
appeal, given that the case on the merits was mutually and voluntarily dismissed in 
its entirety, and no case or controversy remains between the parties.

CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
AdjustaCam, LLC (“AdjustaCam”) brought this action in July 2010 against 
59 defendants, including Defendant Sakar, alleging that certain camera products 
sold by Sakar infringed United States Patent No. 5,885,343 (“the ’343 Patent”), 
entitled “Camera Clip.”  A0004.  The ’343 Patent is owned by Global-Media 
Group, LLC and AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of the patent.  A1789. 
After filing suit AdjustaCam began seeking to settle with the defendants.  
All defendants other than Defendant Sakar and Newegg Inc., Newegg.com, Inc., 
and Rosewill, Inc. (collectively, “Newegg” or “the Newegg Defendants”) settled 
with AdjustaCam well before trial and were dismissed.  However, 20 out of 22 
twenty defendants settled for less than [[$100,000]]. A1282. 
During the reexamination, on August 12, 2011, the USPTO issued a first 
Office Action and rejected the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent, as being 
anticipated and/or obvious based on Japanese Utility Model Publication No. H2-
19997 to Irifune (the “Irifune Publication”) and U.S. Patent No. 5,880,783 to Ma 
entitled “Digital Camera for a Computer” (the “Ma Patent”).  
Then a Markman hearing was held on February 9, 2012 to construe various 
claim terms of the ’343 Patent.  A0013.  Magistrate Judge Love issued a Markman 
order on April 10, 2012, which was subsequently adopted in full by Chief Judge 
Davis on June 7, 2012.  A0013-27; A0012 (“the Markman Order”).   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 211 of 242   Page ID #:211
4 
 
In the Markman Order, the Court considered the term “[r]otatably attached / 
adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach.” A0020-23.  
Adjustacam argued that the term as used in the claims “allow[s] for a ‘rotatably 
attached’ object to rotate over more than a single axis.”  A0020.  However, the 
district court agreed with the defendants, deciding that “[t]he claims plainly 
describe each ‘rotatably attached’ object as rotating about a single axis.”  A0022.  
The district court also explained that “[e]very reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ 
object in the specification and claims describes the attachment as permitting 
motion over a single axis of rotation.”  A0021.   
Since Sakar’s accused products had essentially a ball and socket joint, it was 
clear that Sakar accused products had multiple axes of rotation, and not just one or 
two axes of rotation, as required by the ’343 Patent claims.  Therefore, it was clear 
that there was no infringement for Sakar’s camera having a multi-axis ball and 
socket joint. 
At the same time, AdjustaCam’s counsel was also delaying and prolonging 
the reexamination of the validity of the ’343 Patent for one year until August 30, 
2012, when the USPTO finally rejected the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent 
during a third Office Action as being not patentable and therefore invalid.  This 
was more than 2 years into the case, and most of the defendants had already settled 
except for Sakar, and the Newegg Defendants. Then, on September 20, 2012, after 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 212 of 242   Page ID #:212
5 
 
most of the defendants had settled, AdjustaCam’s counsel finally responded to the 
USPTO by cancelling the asserted claims from the ’343 Patent. AdjustaCam could 
have cancelled the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent (or at least withdrawn them 
from this litigation) long before September 20. Instead, AdjustaCam acted in bad 
faith by asserting frivolous responses to the USPTO’s first two rejections between 
August 12, 2011 and August 30, 2012, in order to buy additional time to enter into 
additional nuisance-value settlements. 
After AdjustaCam dismissed both the asserted claims and Sakar from the 
case, Sakar filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees (totaling $163,522), 
which was denied by the trial court.  A0156, A0160.   
  On Sept. 18, 2013, Sakar then filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the 
denial of its motion for attorneys’ fees. Although AdjustaCam’s notice of appeal 
also referred to the district court’s final judgment, that final judgment was not 
premised on any claim construction issues, nor did AdjustaCam seek a consent 
judgment incorporating the claim construction order as the basis for a judgment of 
non-infringement.  Rather, the final judgment merely reflected the parties’ agreed 
mutual dismissal of the case.  A0001-03; A1986-87. 
Meanwhile, shortly before this appeal was reactivated, the Supreme Court 
decided Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 213 of 242   Page ID #:213

(2014), which relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 
285. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Unable to force a nuisance-value settlement payment from Sakar after more 
than two years of litigation, and since all of the defendants had settled except for 
Sakar and the Newegg Defendants, AdjustaCam decided to dismiss Sakar with 
prejudice in order to end the case.   
This action by AdjustaCam was intended to extort nuisance-value settlement 
fees from defendants, and not to resolve any legitimate claims of infringement or 
damages.  In fact, AdjustaCam knew at the time of the first Office Action rejection 
of the claims on August 12, 2011, that AdjustaCam could not prevail. Yet, 
AdjustaCam did not withdraw the patent claims and continued with the prosecution 
of its infringement claims and with the settlements. Such a baseless case that 
abuses the judiciary for personal gain is exceptional and warrants fee shifting. 
By the time Sakar filed its motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, 
AdjustaCam had forced Sakar to spend a total of $163,522, including $143,933 in 
attorney’s fees and $19,589 in expert witness fees to defend itself.  A1793-94.  
Sakar contends that it should not have to bear these fees, and that Sakar should be 
reimbursed by AdjustaCam

II. The Parties 
 
AdjustaCam is a limited liability company that is exclusively in the business 
of patent litigation.  As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acacia Research Group, 
LLC, its business follows the model of using the burden and expense of patent 
litigation as leverage to extort settlement fees from defendants.  A1779. 
Sakar is a wholesaler of consumer electronics products and accessories that 
it sells to various retailers throughout the United States under the brand name 
VIVITAR®.  Sakar does not manufacture its products, including the accused 
webcam products in this case, but simply purchases its products from third parties 
in China and then resells them in the United States.  Sakar’s accused webcam 
products in this case were sold under Sakar’s licensed brand name “Kodak.”  
A large number of defendants in this case were retailers, who simply 
purchased and re-sold the accused cameras and were not manufacturers who 
actually made the accused cameras. 
III. 
AdjustaCam’s Infringement Allegations 
 
AdjustaCam is the exclusive licensee of United States Patent No. 5,855,343 
(“the ’343 Patent”), entitled “Camera Clip.”   A1789.   The ’343 Patent is generally 
directed to a camera clip that supports a camera when sitting on a flat surface or 
when attached to an object, such as a computer monitor: 
 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 215 of 242   Page ID #:215
8 
 
                                
 
 
’343 Patent, Figs. 1, 2, 4.  The clip allows the camera to rotate in two distinct 
directions about distinct axes of rotation. 
First, as shown in Fig. 1, the camera can be rotated to pan side-to-side.  The 
specification explains: “[h]inge member 16 is rotatably attached to camera 12, 
where camera 12 rotates over a first axis 26 in a direction shown by arrow 28 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 216 of 242   Page ID #:216
9 
 
relative to hinge member 16.”  ’343 Patent, at 4:17-19.  Second, as shown in Fig. 2, 
the camera can be tilted upward and downward.  The specification explains: 
“[h]inge member 16 rotates over a second axis 32 in the direction shown by arrow 
34 relative to support frame 18.  First axis 26 is perpendicular to second axis 32.”  
 ’343 Patent, at 4:21-24. 
 
These two different axes of rotation are expressly required by all 
independent claims in the ’343 Patent.  In Claim 1 (“a hinge member adapted to be 
rotatably attached to the camera, said camera, when the hinge member is so 
attached, rotating, about a first axis of rotation, relative to said hinge member”); 
Claim 1 also requires (“a support frame rotatably attached to said hinge member ...,  
said hinge member rotating about a second axis of rotation relative to said support 
frame, said first axis of rotation being generally perpendicular to said second axis 
of rotation”).   
Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the term “[r]otatably 
attached / adapted to be rotatably attached / adapted to rotatably attach” as used in 
the claims indicated that “‘rotatably attached’ objects in the patent-in-suit are 
limited to a single axis of rotation.”  A0022-23.  
Unlike the camera covered by the ’343 Patent, Sakar’s accused cameras do 
not rotate about a single axis of rotation. Instead, Sakar’s cameras (the “Accused 
Ball-and-Socket Products”) include a camera connected to a support frame via a 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 217 of 242   Page ID #:217
10 
 
ball-and-socket joint, which permits rotation about multiple axes, not just a first 
and second axis of rotation, as claimed. 
Thus, the structure of Sakar’s camera is different, since the Accused Ball-
and-Socket Camera structure of Sakar is different from the structure of the ’343 
Patent claims, as illustrated by the following photographs of the accused Kodak 
webcams (Model Nos. Kodak S101 and Kodak T130): 
 
 
A0307.  The nature of these ball-and-socket joints is that they allow for rotation for 
each of the parts of the camera product about multiple axes—the camera is able to 
spin and pivot about multiple axes of rotation with respect to the socket (not just 
a single axis), and the support frame is likewise able to spin and pivot about 
multiple axes of rotation with respect to the ball (not just a single axis). A0296-
98.  Comparing Sakar’s products to the claims and specification of the ’343 Patent 
shows that AdjustaCam’s infringement allegations were baseless from the 
outset.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 218 of 242   Page ID #:218
11 
 
Therefore, AdjustaCam’s bad faith is evident. Eltech Sys. Corp. v. PPG 
Indus., Inc., 903 F.2d 805, 811 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“Where, as here, the patentee is 
manifestly unreasonable in assessing infringement, while continuing to assert 
infringement in court, an inference is proper of bad faith.”). 
In addition, AdjustaCam’s own expert, Dr. Muskivitch, admitted three times 
during his deposition on cross-examination that Sakar’s Kodak webcams with a 
ball and stem fixed to the camera DO NOT rotate about a single axis of rotation 
as required by asserted claims 1(a) and 19(a):  
   
1) First Admission 
 
A. Yes. The stem and the ball and the camera all are -- if you are  
 
 
going to rotate it, they will all rotate together. 
 
Q. Okay. So am I correct, would you be -- is it correct to say that the  
 
 
Kodak camera does not rotate relative to the stem and ball because  
 
 
they are fixed to each other? 
 
A. That’s correct. (Muskivitch Deposition, p.280, ll.4-12); 
 
2) Second Admission 
 
Q. Well, we have -- we have already talked about the relationship  
 
 
between the camera and the stem and ball, and we have agreed earlier  
 
 
-- or you agreed earlier that -- that in a Kodak webcam, there is no  
 
 
rotational movement between the -- the camera and the ball and stem  
 
 
that fits [are  fixed] together. Do you remember that? 
 
A. Yeah, sure, sure. (Id. at 308, ll.12-19); and 
 
3) Third Admission 
 
Q. Okay. But there is no relative movement between the ball and  
 
 
stem, which are -- and the camera, which are fixed together,  
 
 
 
correct? 
 
A. I agree. Right. (Id. at 311, ll.14-17).   
 
(A0297-98).  
 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 219 of 242   Page ID #:219
12 
 
Based on the foregoing admissions by AdjustaCam’s expert, there could 
never have been any infringement by Sakar’s Accused Ball-and-Socket Product.   
IV. 
AdjustaCam’s Validity Arguments 
 
 
In its two arguments to the Patent Office, AdjustaCam also took frivolous 
positions in distinguishing the prior art cited by the Examiner, such as Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. H2-19997 to Irifune (“Irifune”). This prior art 
discloses a camera rotatably attached to a hinge member (mounting device (2)) via 
the threaded “camera attachment shaft (9)”: 
 
A1386, A1387, A1394.  AdjustaCam’s expert incorrectly asserted that Irifune does 
not disclose a device that can be rotatably attached to a camera.   Dr. Muskivitch 
argued that “[w]ith Irifune, the camera is not even attached to the hinge member 
until fully tightened down using camera attachment shaft (9) and camera 
attachment screws (10 and (11).” A1263.  Using an exceedingly narrow definition 
of “attached” (“permanently fixed joined, connected, or bound”), Dr. Muskivitch 
argued that Irifune did not meet the claim requirements because “[o]nce the camera 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 220 of 242   Page ID #:220
13 
 
is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera cannot rotate about a first axis relative to 
the hinge member.”  Id.   In Dr. Muskivitch’s view, when the camera of Irifune is 
screwed all the way onto the hinge member, the camera cannot be rotated, and if 
the camera is loosened to permit rotation, the camera is not attached.  Id. (“[E]ven 
assuming for the sake of argument that with Irifune the camera is attached, it is not 
“rotatably attached.”). 
In the first office action, on August 12, 2011, in a reexamination proceeding 
regarding the ’343 Patent, the USPTO rejected the asserted claims as 
anticipated and/or obvious based on Irifune.  A1425; A1431-36; A1376-96 
(English translation of Irifune).  Like Dr. Muskivitch later did in the litigation, 
during the reexamination proceedings patent owner Global-Media argued that the 
camera of Irifune is not “rotatably attached” to the hinge member because the 
camera “is not attached to the hinge member until fully screwed or threaded to the 
hinge member.” A1448.  To make such an argument, Global-Media posited that the 
plain and ordinary meaning of attached is “permanently fixed, joined, connected, 
or bound.” A1447. The examiner rejected this argument twice, correctly 
concluding that “it is clearly possible to loosen the attachment screw, to enable the 
pivoting of the camera relative to support (fixed part 2) while the camera is still 
attached to the support.” A1508-10; A1476.  After the third office action, which 
was a final rejection based on Irifune, AdjustaCam cancelled all the asserted claims  
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 221 of 242   Page ID #:221

on September 20, 2012, which effectively ended the case. By that time, all the 
parties had settled, except Sakar and NewEgg.  A1515-19, A1460, A1465, A1469-
74, A1493, A1502-06. 
V. AdjustaCam’s Nuisance-Value Settlements and Demands 
 
Sakar, like its co-defendants, was served with a lawsuit and was then 
approached by AdjustaCam to discuss settlement of the case.  Nearly every 
defendant proceeded to settle for a dollar amount well under the cost to defend 
oneself against the infringement allegations, 20 out of 22 for less than 
[[$100,000]].  A1282 (AdjustaCam settlement agreement summary). 
AdjustaCam and its damages expert state that AdjustaCam’s settlement 
agreements were based on an established target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit. See 
A1195-97  (“In its licensing program for this litigation, AdjustaCam used this 
$1.25 - $1.50 per webcam royalty rate as a baseline for licensing the various 
defendants.”); A1324. The chart below does not support this royalty rate alleged by 
AdjustaCam: 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 222 of 242   Page ID #:222

Attachment 12 
Implied Royalty Rates 
 
[[ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       ]] 
A1283-85.   
The alleged basis for the target royalty of $1.25-$1.50/unit was two 
settlement and license agreements entered into in 2001 by one of AdjustaCam’s 
predecessors in interest, PAR Technologies, both of which included lump sum 
payments plus prospective running royalty components.  A1197; A1282; A1303-
06.  One of these agreements had a tiered prospective royalty structure ranging 
from [[$1.00 to $8.00]] per unit as the number of units increased, and the other had 
a royalty structure of [[$1.25]] per unit that decreased to [[zero]] as the sales 
volume increased.  A0542-45; A0631.  From these two PAR Technologies 
agreements alone, to the exclusion of the more than twenty other licenses that do 
not support the proffered royalty rage, and without making any comparison of the 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 223 of 242   Page ID #:223
 
15 
 
PAR Technologies licenses to the facts of the case against Sakar, AdjustaCam and 
its expert took the unsupported position that “a royalty in the $1.25 to $1.50 frame” 
was an appropriate and consistent target for licensing discussions.  A1305-06. 
 AdjustaCam also asserts that “AdjustaCam’s settlement numbers were tied 
to a pre-established unit royalty of $1.25 - $1.50 per infringing device.” A1201.  
But AdjustaCam has no proof of this established royalty rate. See, e.g., Rude v. 
Westcott, 130 U.S. 152, 165 (1889); Hanson v. Alpine Valley Ski Area, Inc., 718 
F.2d 1075, 1078 (Fed. Cir. 1983).   
Settlements were untied to Sakar’s sales of the accused cameras.  However, 
Sakar refused all of AdjustaCam’s settlement demands in 2011 and 2012 because 
the asserted claims of the ’343 Patent were not infringed, invalid, and had been 
rejected by the U.S. Patent Office. 
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 
 
This lawsuit by AdjustaCam sued Sakar and its dozens of co-defendants was 
for the purpose of seeking nuisance-value settlement payments.   
AdjustaCam’s patent covers a camera that is claimed to rotate in a single 
axis of rotation.  But it is undisputed that Sakar’s ball-and-socket joint rotated 
about multiple axes of rotation, not a single axis of rotation.    
 
Even after the district court construed the claims against AdjustaCam, 
AdjustaCam continued to pursue many nuisance-value settlement offers.   
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 224 of 242   Page ID #:224
 
17 
 
To make matters worse, all Sakar’s time and money (totaling $163,522 in 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees) was wasted on defending this frivolous lawsuit 
even though AdjustaCam knew for nearly a year before Sakar was dismissed that 
Sakar’s accused ball and socket product did not infringe. 
Because AdjustaCam did not litigate in good faith, this case “stands out from 
the others” and is exceptional under Octane Fitness, and is also sufficiently 
egregious to warrant expert fee shifting.  Accordingly, this Court should remand 
the case to determine the amount of Sakar’s recoverable fees. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
The denial of a motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.  Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 134 S. 
Ct. 1744, 1747 (2014) (“[A]n appellate court should review all aspects of a district 
court’s § 285 determination for abuse of discretion.”).   
A district court’s decision not to award expert fees under its inherent 
authority is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 
“The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate court’s 
correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: ‘A district court would 
necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 225 of 242   Page ID #:225
 
18 
 
law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’”  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. 
at 1748 n. 2 (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990)). 
ARGUMENT 
 
I. The District Court Abused its Discretion by Not Finding This Case 
Exceptional and Egregious 
 
 
The Supreme Court in its recent Octane Fitness decision explained that, 
under 35 U.S.C. § 285, “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out from 
others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position 
(considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable 
manner in which the case was litigated.”  134 S. Ct. at 1756.  “District courts may 
determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-by-case exercise of their 
discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.”  Id.  For particularly 
egregious cases, district courts also have the inherent authority to award expert 
fees.  MarcTec v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 
As noted above, the district court decided Sakar’s motion before Octane 
Fitness relaxed the standard for finding a case “exceptional” under Section 285.  In 
denying Sakar’s motion, the district court recited and applied the then-applicable 
law under Brooks Furniture Mfg. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. 
Cir. 2005), stating that absent material inappropriate conduct in litigation, “an 
exceptional case may only be found if ‘both (1) the litigation is brought in 
subjective bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively baseless.’”  A0005. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 226 of 242   Page ID #:226
 
19 
 
Unlike under the Brooks Furniture standard relied on by the district court, 
the exceptionality standard does not require proof of both objective baselessness 
and bad faith, or require misconduct to be independently sanctionable, or require 
proof by clear and convincing evidence.  Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1757-58.  
Here, because the district court erred by denying Sakar’s motion under the strict 
Brooks Furniture standard, it certainly also erred under the far less burdensome 
Octane Fitness standard as well.   
In denying Sakar’s motion for attorneys’ fees and expert fees, the district 
court misapprehended the evidence.  Under the test of Brooks Furniture or Octane 
Fitness, the “clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence” constitutes an abuse of 
discretion.  Highmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1748 n. 2. 
A. AdjustaCam Filed and Prosecuted This Case in Bad Faith 
 
According to the district court, “there is insufficient evidence that the action 
was brought in bad faith and for an improper purpose.”  A0006.  In fact, the 
evidence of bad faith was overwhelming. 
It is clear that AdjustaCam pursued Sakar for two years on patent claims that 
were facially not infringed by the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products.  
However, AdjustaCam continued with its case even after the Patent Office rejected 
the patentability of the claims on August 12, 2011, and even after the Markman 
Order emphatically precluded any possible infringement.  See infra.    
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 227 of 242   Page ID #:227
 
20 
 
1. AdjustaCam Brought this Case for the Improper Purpose of 
Obtaining Nuisance-Value Settlements 
 
AdjustaCam’s settlements, as well as the settlement demands made to Sakar, 
were not reasonably tied to a particular royalty rate. District courts should not 
permit such flagrant bad faith.   
The lower Court stated that “low settlement offers . . . effectively ensure [] 
that [the patentee’s] baseless infringement allegations remained unexposed, 
allowing [the patentee] to continue to collect additional nuisance value 
settlements.”  Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, 653 F.3d 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 
2011); see also Am. Standard, Inc. v. York Int’l Corp., 244 F. Supp. 2d 990, 997 
(W.D. Wis. 2002) (Bad faith litigation tactics “force defendants into settlement and 
away from their legitimate defenses.”); Artese v. Academy Collection Service, No. 
3:96-cv-2546-GLG, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186, at *10 (D. Conn. Jan. 18, 2000) 
(holding that the filing of many lawsuits seeking relatively small settlements “gives 
rise to a suspicion of barratry and champerty”).   
As stated above, the settlement amounts in this case are small compared to 
the cost of defense, showing that AdjustaCam’s desire was to obtain settlements..  
When Sakar, after nearly two years, still refused to settle, AdjustaCam’s response 
exposed its true purpose.  Such an “overall vexatious litigation strategy” that is 
wasteful of judicial resources evidences bad faith.  See Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. 
v. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd., 726 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2013).    
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 228 of 242   Page ID #:228

In Monolithic Power Systems, the case was deemed exceptional in large part 
because the plaintiff “withdrew its claims and granted covenants not to sue after 
substantial litigation had taken place,” “moving to dismiss only after [defendants] 
had completed their filings for the final pretrial conference, wasting the parties’ 
and the court’s resources.”  Id.  Similarly, AdjustaCam waited two years to dismiss 
Sakar, and did not actually dismiss Sakar until after Sakar had incurred 
considerable expense in attorney fees and expert fees.  AdjustaCam cannot just 
lose the case and dismiss it with zero consequences after forcing Sakar to spend 
$163,522 in attorneys’ fees and expert fees to defend itself.   
In Ingenuity 13, LLC v. Doe, copyright plaintiffs were found to have acted in 
bad faith and sanctioned for fees in circumstances largely identical to those in this 
case.  No. 2:12-cv-8333-ODW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64564 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 
2013).  First, the plaintiffs engaged in a strategy to file lawsuits against many 
defendants.  Id. at *6-7.  Due to “the high cost of litigation,” “[m]ost defendants 
settled . . . , resulting in proceeds of millions of dollars due to the numerosity of 
defendants.”  Id.  “For defendants that refused to settle, the Principals engaged in 
vexatious litigation designed to coerce settlement.”  
It is unfair for a plaintiff to force Sakar to endure the substantial burden and 
expense of litigation and then lose the case and dismiss it. See Upthegrove v. 
Health Prof’ls, LTD., No. 07-cv-0596-BBC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4546, at *12 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 229 of 242   Page ID #:229
 
22 
 
(W.D. Wis. Jan. 21, 2009) (“Plaintiff cannot expect to subject defendant Rose to a 
year of litigation and walk away with no consequences.”); compare Monolithic 
Power Sys., 726 F.3d at 1367 (affirming award of fees, emphasizing that vexatious 
case was dismissed “after substantial litigation had taken place . . . wasting the 
parties’ and the court’s resources”). 
Section 285’s exceptional case provision exists precisely to prevent “gross 
injustice to an alleged infringer.” Mathis v. Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 755 (Fed. Cir. 
1988).  Sakar was left with considerable and unjustifiable litigation costs, making 
this case exceptional and abusive.  
2. Nuisance Litigation is Exceptional and Egregious 
 
Patent-type nuisance litigation brought by a patent owner has become a 
lucrative industry.  See, e.g., Colleen V. Chien, Patent Trolls by the Numbers, 
Santa Clara University Studies Research Paper No. 08-13, available 
at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2233041 (March 13, 2013) (explaining that patent 
assertion entities file the majority patent lawsuits in the U.S., primarily targeting 
non-technology companies). 
The case of Octane Fitness explained that “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply 
one that stands out from others” regarding weak merits positions or litigation 
misconduct.  134 S. Ct. at 1756.   
Section 285 is supposed to be remedial—to correct for unfairness and 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 230 of 242   Page ID #:230
 
23 
 
injustice.  See Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1753, 1756 n.6; see also Kilopass 
Tech., Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302,  1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2013).   
As stated in Eon-Net, 653 F.3d at 1328 (“[T]he appetite for licensing 
revenue cannot overpower a litigant’s and its counsel’s obligation to file cases 
reasonably based in law and fact and to litigate those cases in good faith.”).  
3. Nuisance Litigation Should be Discouraged 
 
Octane Fitness recognizes that the Court’s power to award attorneys’ fees 
should be a deterrent effect on bad faith litigation and misconduct.  134 S. Ct. at 
1756 n.6 (reminding district courts of “the need in particular circumstances to 
advance considerations of compensation and deterrence”).  AdjustaCam cannot be 
allowed to file a baseless case, and then after losing the case (claims declared 
invalid), AdjustaCam’s only consequence is to dismiss the case.  See Kilopass, 738 
F.3d at 1317 (“[T]rial courts retain broad discretion to make findings of 
exceptionality under § 285 in a wide variety of circumstances.”).   
If AdjustaCam’s conduct is not deemed exceptional and egregious in this 
case, it will embolden nuisance litigants to continue their abusive conduct 
unchecked.   
B. The Accused Cameras Could Not Possibly Have Infringed 
 
The district court agreed with AdjustaCam that the Accused Ball-and-Socket 
Products included constrained ball-and-socket joints that restricted movement to 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 231 of 242   Page ID #:231
 
24 
 
some extent.  A0006. According to the district court, this constricted movement 
made it possible for AdjustaCam to prevail in proving infringement: 
[i]f the ball and socket joint truly restricts the range of movement 
such that it cannot rotate about multiple axes, the constrained ball and 
socket joint could meet the claim limitation which requires the hinge 
member being rotatably attached to the camera in a single axis of 
rotation.  Since one could reasonably argue Defendants’ products 
meet the “rotatably attached” limitation, AdjustaCam’s infringement 
theories are not objectively baseless. 
 
A0006.  However, it is undisputed that the Accused Ball-and-Socket Products 
included cameras that were in fact capable of rotating about multiple axes with 
respect to the socket—they could be both twisted and tilted up and down. 
See A0022 (“The claims plainly describe each ‘rotatably attached’ object as 
rotating about a single axis.”); A0021 (“Every reference to a ‘rotatably attached’ 
object in the specification and claims describes the attachment as permitting 
motion over a single axis of rotation.”).  Therefore, from the beginning of this 
lawsuit, no reasonable plaintiff could have expected to succeed in proving 
infringement. 
The situation would be somewhat different if AdjustaCam honestly did not 
know that infringement was impossible to prove at the outset of the case, but later 
discovered that it could not prevail.  Here, such ignorance is implausible given the 
readily apparent functionality of the accused products and the simplicity of the 
patent and its claims.  But even if AdjustaCam could legitimately plead ignorance, 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 232 of 242   Page ID #:232
 
25 
 
ignorance is no excuse to continue undeterred—for nearly five months, which 
included considerable and expensive expert discovery—after the district court’s 
decisive Markman ruling in Sakar’s favor.  A0013-27 (April 10, 2012 Markman 
Order).  Here, as in MarcTec, AdjustaCam “not only initiated a frivolous lawsuit, it 
persisted in advancing unfounded arguments that unnecessarily extended this 
litigation and caused [defendant] to incur needleless litigation expenses. This 
vexatious conduct is, by definition, litigation misconduct, and provides a separate 
and independent basis supporting the district court’s determination that this case is 
exceptional.”  MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 907, at 920-21 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012).    
C. AdjustaCam’s Validity Positions Were Frivolous 
 
As explained above, AdjustaCam advanced the following incorrect argument 
to the Patent Office:  “With Irifune, the camera is not even attached to the hinge 
member until fully tightened down using camera attachment shaft (9) and camera 
attachment screws (10 and (11).” A1263.  Using the exceedingly narrow definition 
of “attached” offered in the reexamination, AdjustaCam’s expert Dr. Muskivitch 
opined that, “[o]nce the camera is attached to the fixed part 2, the camera cannot 
rotate about a first axis relative to the hinge member.”  Id.  These conducted 
arugments were objectively baseless for several reasons. 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 233 of 242   Page ID #:233
 
26 
 
II. AdjustaCam’s Appeal Must be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction 
 
AdjustaCam brought its own affirmative appeal to this Court, but there is no 
subject matter jurisdiction.  There is no legal support whatsoever for AdjustaCam’s 
attempt to appeal a claim construction issue that it lost in the district court, made 
no effort to preserve for appeal, and expressly extinguished when it dismissed its 
case against Sakar with prejudice. This frivolous appeal only compounds the 
exceptionality of this case and causes Sakar to incur further needless legal 
expenses. 
An “actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at 
the time the complaint was filed.”  Benitec Austl, Ltd. v. Nucleonics, Inc., 495 F.3d 
1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 
(1974)).  “Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold requirement for a court’s power 
to exercise jurisdiction over a case, and no amount of ‘prudential reasons’ or 
perceived increases in efficiency, however sound, can empower a federal court to 
hear a case where there is no extant case or controversy.”  Dow Jones & Co., Inc. 
v. Ablaise Ltd., 606 F.3d 1338, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
AdjustaCam filed its notice of appeal seeking review of the district court’s 
claim construction rulings.  A0193.  But by that time, Sakar had already been 
dismissed with prejudice from the case and given a covenant not to be sued in the 
future for infringement of the ’343 Patent.  A1955-57; A0319-20; A0158.  The 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 234 of 242   Page ID #:234
 
27 
 
dismissal and covenant extinguished any ongoing disputes between AdjustaCam 
and Sakar concerning the infringement and validity of the ’343 Patent.   
This Court has often recognized its inability to reach claim construction 
issues that are not subject to an ongoing case or controversy. See, e.g, SanDisk 
Corp. v. Kingston Tech. Co., 695 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[W]here, as 
here, a party’s claim construction arguments do not affect the final judgment 
entered by the court, they are not reviewable. . . . Without a final judgment as to 
the infringement or validity of these claims, the court’s claim constructions that 
impact only these withdrawn claims are not properly before us.”); Jang v. Boston 
Sci. Corp., 532 F.3d 1330, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (resolving claim construction 
issues “that do not actually affect the infringement controversy between the 
parties” would result in impermissible advisory opinion because “[t]he Supreme 
Court has explicitly held that Article III does not permit the courts to resolve issues 
when it is not clear that the resolution of the question will resolve a concrete 
controversy between interested parties”); see also NTP, Inc. v. Research In Motion, 
Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 
Although AdjustaCam purports to appeal from the district court’s final 
judgment, but that final judgment was in no way based on the claim construction 
ruling.  It was instead based entirely on the mutual consent of the parties to end the 
Case 2:15-cv-01395   Document 1   Filed 02/26/15   Page 235 of 242   Page ID #:235
 
28 
 
case.  Therefore, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the claim 
constructions.   
Here, AdjustaCam made no effort whatsoever to preserve any challenges to 
the district court’s claim constructions when it decided to dismiss its case against 
Sakar.   
This Court cannot hear AdjustaCam’s appeal because it lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction over the challenges raised to the claim construction rulings by the 
district court.  AdjustaCam’s appeal must be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be 
reversed, this case should be declared exceptional and egregious, and the case 
should be remanded for a determination of the amount of attorneys’ fees and expert 
fees owed to Sakar.   
 
Additionally, AdjustaCam’s appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.

Paragraph 36 of the Complaint does not contain any factual allegations directed to 
FleischmanGarcia that may be either admitted or denied.  To the extent a response is required, 
FleischmanGarcia would state it is without knowledge and would thusly deny the allegations 
contained in paragraph 36, and further, FleischmanGarcia would state that it is employed the 
services of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, in this action and has agreed to pay said counsel 
for its services in this action.  Accordingly, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504, FleischmanGarcia 
would request the entry of an order to award a reasonable attorney’s fee to FleischmanGarcia, as 
the prevailing party, as part of the costs of defense in this action. 
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 
First Affirmative Defense 
As its First Affirmative Defense, FleischmanGarcia would state that Innovative Habitat’s 
Complaint is barred by the fact that the alleged copyright-protected work was created in 
collaboration with others, and therefore, Innovative Habitat is not the author and/or owner of the 
subject work. 
Second Affirmative Defense 
As its Second Affirmative Defense, FleischmanGarcia would state that Innovative 
Habitat’s claims are barred by the doctrine of fair use. 
Third Affirmative Defense 
As its Third Affirmative Defense, FleischmanGarcia would state that Innovative 
Habitat’s claims are barred by the doctrine of unclean hands.
Fourth Affirmative Defense 
As its Fourth Affirmative Defense, FleischmanGarcia would state that Innovative 
Habitat’s claims are barred due to an implied license.

P a g e  | 8
Fifth Affirmative Defense 
  As its Fifth Affirmative Defense, FleischmanGarcia would state that Innovative 
Habitat’s claims are barred by the fact that the requested relief would constitute a prior restraint 
in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
Reservation of Right to Assert Additional Affirmative Defenses 
FleischmanGarcia reserves the right to assert additional affirmative defenses based upon 
further investigation and discovery. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, Fleischman and Garcia Architects and Planners, A.I.A., P.A., 
requests the entry of an order from this Court dismissing the Plaintiff Innovative Habitat, LLC’s 
Complaint with prejudice, awarding Defendant, FleischmanGarcia, its reasonable attorneys’ fees 
and costs in defense of this action, and granting such further relief in favor of FleischmanGarcia 
as this Court deems just and proper.

COMPLAINT 
 
Plaintiff Innovative Habitat, LLC, (“Plaintiff” or “Innovative Habitat”) brings this 
action against Defendants Fleischman and Garcia Architects and Planners, A.I.A., P.A. 
(“FleischmanGarcia”) and Atco, Inc. (“Atco”) (collectively “Defendants”) for copyright 
infringement and alleges: 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
1. 
This action arises under the federal Copyright Act of 1976, Title 17, United States 
Code.  Jurisdiction arises from 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). 
2. 
Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 1400(a). 
THE PARTIES 
3. 
Innovative Habitat is a Florida limited liability company in Sarasota, Florida. 
4. 
FleischmanGarcia is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in 
Tampa, Florida. 
Case 8:21-cv-00922-CEH-AEP   Document 1   Filed 04/19/21   Page 1 of 7 PageID 1

5. 
Atco is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Sarasota, Florida. 
BACKGROUND 
6. 
Innovative Habitat is an architecture and design firm. 
7. 
Atco owns and operates numerous gas stations and convenience stores, primarily along 
the West Coast of Florida. 
8. 
In 2019, at the behest of Gigi Rogers, the daughter of Atco’s founder and an interior 
designer, Atco launched a new convenience store brand, known as Rogers Market, focusing 
on “an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere [and] high-quality chef-made food.”1 
9. 
In or about February of 2019, Innovative Habitat and Atco entered into an agreement 
pursuant to which Innovative Habitat provided architectural design services for a new Rogers 
Market to be constructed at 2415 63rd Avenue East, Bradenton, Florida 34203 (the “Bradenton 
Rogers Market”). 
10. 
The Bradenton Rogers Market was the first store that Atco built specifically to be a 
Rogers Market, as opposed to remodeling an existing convenience store. 
11. 
Architect Bradley J. Smith (“Smith”), the principal of Innovative Habitat, designed the 
Bradenton Rogers Market from the ground up, translating Gigi Rogers’s vision of an 
aesthetically pleasing atmosphere and “a place where both a trucker and a soccer mom can 
choose between charred avocado toast with ricotta cheese or a Philly cheese steak”2 into an 
original and distinctive architectural design embodied in his plans and drawings.

12. 
Innovative Habitat registered its architectural design for the Bradenton Rogers Market 
with the United States Copyright Office, which on or about February 4, 2020 issued copyright 
registration number VAu001395750. 
13. 
The architectural design of the Bradenton Rogers Market includes numerous unique 
and original design features, which are intended to distinguish Rogers Market from, in the 
words of Gigi Rogers, “yucky” convenience stores and therefore depart from customary styles 
and industry standards. 
14. 
Innovative Habitat provided Atco with drawings, blueprints, schematics and CAD and 
Revit files containing its architectural designs in order for Atco to obtain permits and build the 
Bradenton Rogers Market. 
15. 
Architect Smith, the principal of Innovative Habitat, is shown as the principal architect 
of record on building permit drawings recorded in Manatee County, Florida in connection with 
the construction of the Bradenton Rogers Market. 
16. 
Innovative Habitat did not transfer its copyright in the architectural design of the 
Bradenton Rogers Market to Atco.   
17. 
The Bradenton Rogers Market was completed and opened for business in or about 
September of 2020. 
18. 
In February of 2021, Smith noticed a Rogers Market being built at 1155 Beneva Road, 
Sarasota, Florida 34232 (the “Beneva Rogers Market”) that appeared to be substantially similar 
to and include many of the unique and original design features included in the Bradenton 
Rogers Market. 
Case 8:21-cv-00922-CEH-AEP   Document 1   Filed 04/19/21   Page 3 of 7 PageID 3
4 
 
19. 
Smith obtained copies of the building permit drawings submitted by or on behalf of 
Atco to Sarasota County in connection with the construction of the Beneva Rogers Market. 
20. 
The architectural design embodied in the building permit drawings for the Beneva 
Rogers Market is effectively identical to the original and copyrighted architectural designs 
created by Smith on behalf of Innovative Habitat and incorporates the same distinctive design 
elements and details as the Bradenton Rogers Market. 
21. 
Architect Douglas J. Watters (“Watters”), an employee of FleischmanGarcia, is shown 
as the principal architect of record on the building permit drawings on file with Sarasota 
County for the Beneva Rogers Market. 
22. 
Innovative Habitat notified Watters and FleischmanGarcia of its copyrighted 
architectural design for the Bradenton Rogers Market and the substantial and significant 
similarities in the Bradenton and Beneva Rogers Markets. 
23. 
Watters and FleischmanGarcia did not respond; instead, Atco responded by letter dated 
March 12, 2021, in which it stated the architectural design for the Bradenton Rogers Market 
came from Atco and Gigi Rogers, not Innovative Habitat. 
COUNT I – COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
24. 
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 23 as if set forth fully herein. 
25. 
Plaintiff is the owner of the entire right, title and interest in and to and the creator of 
the original architectural designs for the Bradenton Rogers Market (the “Copyrighted Work”). 
26. 
The Copyrighted Work is an original work of authorship, fixed in tangible mediums, 
created by Smith in his capacity as the principal and owner of Innovative Habitat. 
Case 8:21-cv-00922-CEH-AEP   Document 1   Filed 04/19/21   Page 4 of 7 PageID 4
5 
 
27. 
The Plaintiff registered its original architectural design with the United States 
Copyright Office on or about February 4, 2020. 
28. 
Plaintiff published and distributed the Copyrighted Work in strict conformity with the 
provision of the Copyright Act and has met all conditions precedent to the filing of this action. 
29. 
Defendants Atco and FleischmanGarcia infringed the Plaintiff’s copyright by copying 
the Copyrighted Work, submitting building permit drawings containing the Copyrighted Work 
to Sarasota County to obtain construction and other permits and/or constructing and 
participating in the construction of the Beneva Rogers Market, which is effectively a duplicate 
of the Bradenton Rogers Market and contains identical design elements and details. 
30. 
Defendants had access to the Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Work and actual notice that the 
Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Work is the subject of copyright registrations prior to the infringement. 
31. 
Defendants knowingly and willfully infringed on the Plaintiff’s copyright and have 
gained an economic benefit through their infringement. 
32. 
Defendants’ actions cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff and give rise to this cause 
of action pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 501. 
33. 
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 502, this Court may grant temporary and final injunctions 
restraining Defendants, their officers, agents and employees, and all persons acting in concert 
with Defendants, from engaging in further acts in violation of the Copyright Act as set forth in 
Title 17 of the United States Code. 
34. 
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 503, this Court may order the seizure and impounding by the 
Court of all copies made or used in violation of the Plaintiff’s copyrights as alleged herein, 
Case 8:21-cv-00922-CEH-AEP   Document 1   Filed 04/19/21   Page 5 of 7 PageID 5
6 
 
together with all files, copies or other articles by means of which such copies may be 
reproduced by Defendants. 
35. 
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504, Defendants are liable for Plaintiff’s actual damages and 
any additional profits of the Defendants or statutory damages resulting from Defendants’ 
infringement of the Copyrighted Work. 
36. 
Plaintiff has employed the services of attorney Bailey Lowther and agreed to pay a 
reasonable fee for her services. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury and asks this Court to order that 
Defendants: be preliminarily enjoined from infringing the Plaintiff’s copyright by inter alia 
constructing any building embodying or containing the Plaintiff’s original architectural work; 
turn over to the Court all copies made or used in violation of the Plaintiff’s copyright as alleged 
herein, together with all files, copies or other articles by means of which such copies may be 
reproduced by Defendants; pay to Plaintiff such damages as Plaintiff has sustained as a result 
of Defendants’ infringement of Plaintiff’s copyright and account for and disgorge all gains, 
profits and advantages obtained by Defendants through their infringement of Plaintiff’s 
copyright, or, alternatively, be required to pay statutory damages for the infringement, willful 
and otherwise, of Plaintiff’s copyright; pay Plaintiff for the costs of this action and Plaintiff’s 
reasonable attorney fees in prosecuting this action; and for such other and further relief as is 
equitable and just under the circumstances.

the excessive fines provisions of the Constitutions) because, among other things, the 
alleged wrongful conduct at issue here is not sufficiently reprehensible to warrant

grossly exceed any actual damages to Plaintiff. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot recover 
statutory and/or punitive damages against Defendants.

if any, are vague, uncertain, imaginary, and speculative.

20. 
At all times relevant, each respective Defendant was the employer, joint 
employer, and/or agent of each of the other respective Co-Defendants, as applicable. 
21. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that respective 
Defendants were associated or affiliated with one or more of the other respective DOE 
Defendants in connection with matters and conduct sued upon herein, as applicable.  
Plaintiffs allege that each respective Defendant was acting with one or more of the 
other respective DOE Defendants pursuant to a common scheme, course of action, 
enterprise or conspiracy and each respective Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for the 
events happenings and damages alleged herein, as applicable. 
22. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that Defendants 
TB, KFG, and AS, and DOES 1 through 5 (“Individual Defendants”) are, and at all 
relevant times herein were, owners of all or a controlling interest of WS, and DOES 
6 through 10 (“Entity Defendants”), and that there existed between the Individual 
Defendants and Entity Defendants, and each of them, a unity of interest and 
ownership, such that any individuality or separateness of such Defendants never 
existed or has ceased, and that the Entity Defendant are the alter egos of the Individual 
Defendants, and each other. 
23. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Individual 
Defendants dominated and controlled the business affairs of the Entity Defendants, 
and each of them.  As a result, adherence to the fiction of a separate existence between 
such Defendants would permit an abuse of the corporate privilege and would sanction 
fraud and promote injustice. 
24. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Court can 
pierce the corporate veil of the Entity Defendants and hold Individual Defendants 
individually liable because of the improper activities as follows: 
a. 
failed to maintain or observe corporate formalities when they 
violated Corporate By Laws by refusing to hold proper Board of Director meetings 
and refused to hold Annual Shareholder Meetings;

Defendants' business addresses; and 
f. 
Individual Defendants under-capitalized the Entity Defendants. 
25. 
Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon 
alleges that the Entity Defendants are the alter egos of the Individual Defendants and 
each other, therefore, Plaintiff may proceed against all such respective Defendants 
directly, as they are each liable jointly and severally for any and all damages suffered 
by Plaintiff. 
26. 
Whenever appearing in this Complaint, all references to “Defendant(s)” 
is intended to be, and shall be deemed, a reference to all such respective Defendants 
in this action, and each of them, named and unnamed, including all fictitiously named 
Defendants. 
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 
27. 
In or around 2016, Plaintiff began a business procuring, advertising, and 
distributing, and selling an eye-lash enhancement product (the “Product”), called 
BoostLash (the “Mark”), that provided the consumer with eye-lash enhancement that 
had never been seen or experienced previously.   
28. 
The Product became a highly sought-after commodity as there was no 
product that could compete with the results it generated for the consumer while still 
only costing the consumer a relatively nominal amount of money.  Because of the low 
cost of the Product, it was accessible to consumers from all socio-economic classes.

29. 
However, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that 
because of the low cost of the Product, the consumers of the product are generally not 
sophisticated shoppers exercising a high degree of care when shopping for the 
Product.     
30. 
Because of the universal access to all levels of wealth, the Product was 
in high demand and the Mark garnered notoriety as a source identifier for the Plaintiff. 
31. 
More importantly, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon 
alleges, that consumers of the Product are familiar with the Mark, and now enter the 
Mark as a search term in search engines, such as Yahoo! Or Google, when looking 
for their next purchase of the Product. 
32. 
Plaintiff has invested a lot of money, time, and hard work in the venture 
and has achieved success in having the Mark. 
33. 
Plaintiff applied for and obtained a registration for trademark to 
“BoostLash” with the United State Patent and Trademark Office.   
34. 
Part of the time, money, and work the Plaintiff invested in the Product 
and the Mark went to creating advertisements with specific words and language in a 
specific order which, as the Plaintiff figured out, would facilitate more end users to 
its website and, ultimately, to purchase the Product.  
35. 
The value of the advertisements became so coveted that the Plaintiff has 
applied for copyright registrations in the advertisements with the U.S. Copyright 
Office in the Library of Congress.   
36. 
Plaintiff filled out and filed the application for one of its advertisements, 
paid the filing fee, and received an applications number for registration of copyright 
in March 2018.  The Plaintiff is waiting on the copyright office to confirm registration.   
37. 
As the success of the Product and the Mark became apparent, a principal 
of the Plaintiff, Yasha, happened to be living with AS, and had been for over five (5) 
years.  This was in or around Summer 2017. 
38. 
AS would regularly ask questions about the Plaintiff’s business, the

business model, the strategies being employed, the Product, the Mark, the 
advertisements, and where to procure the Product.  
39. 
As the questions were the type that would reveal the innerworkings of 
Plaintiff’s business, it was made to be understood to AS by Plaintiff’s principal that 
the information being provided would remain confidential and only for the benefit of 
the Plaintiff, and that AS would not take such information to start his own competing 
business.  Plaintiff’s principal let AS know that such an act would require an 
agreement between AS, and any parties working with him, and the Plaintiff.     
40. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that it was at that 
point that AS decided he, along with FKG and TB, would misappropriate the 
proprietary information being communicated to AS by Plaintiff’s principal, in good 
faith as a curious roommate of over five years, by making the fraudulent 
representations that the information would remain confidential and not be used to start 
a competing business against Plaintiff.         
41. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in November 
2017, AS commenced taking actions exactly opposite of what he represented to 
Plaintiff’s principal he would not do.   
42. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in November 
2017, the Defendants used the information AS nefariously acquired from Plaintiff and 
made a deal with the manufacturer of the Product so the Defendants could sell it under 
their own label, purchased the domain name for WooLash, copied the Plaintiff’s 
advertisement (but ran the advertisement only outside of California in the hopes 
Plaintiff would not see it), and purchased the Google Adwords “Boost” and “Lash,” 
and sold the exact same, but competing, product.  
43. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the 
Defendants’ copied advertisements were non-descript in that an ordinary consumer of 
the Product would not be able to tell, unless investigating closely, that the 
advertisement did not belong to Plaintiff.

44. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants 
purposefully underhandedly gained information from Plaintiff, struck a deal with the 
manufacturer of the Product, called their product something similar to the Mark, used 
“Boost” and “Lash” for their Google Adwords, copied Plaintiff’s advertisement, and 
made their advertisement non-descript so that when the consumer of the Product, who 
is unsophisticated regarding the Product because of the low price point, does a search 
for “BoostLash,” intending to find Plaintiff’s website, the context of the Defendants’ 
uses, as described above, will confuse the consumer to believing Defendants are or 
are endorsed by Plaintiff so that the consumers purchase the product from the 
Defendants  and not the Plaintiff.   
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
(Against All Defendants) 
45. 
All of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through 44 are 
hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein. 
46. 
Plaintiff is the author of an advertisement that is subject to a copyright 
application submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office (the “CC Work”) as a work made 
for hire. 
47. 
In or around March 2018, Plaintiff filed an application for registration 
for the CC Work, paid the application filing fee, and received a confirmation of the 
filing back from the Copyright Office.   
48. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in November 
2017, for a commercial purpose, Defendants knowingly, wrongfully and without 
permission copied word for word and used the CC Work for the purpose of confusing 
consumer into purchasing products from them.  
49. 
Without authorization, the Defendants used, republished, distributed and 
displayed to the public worldwide the CC Work on many different websites and 
search engines.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
INTENTIONAL FRAUD 
(Against AS) 
69. 
All of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through 68 above 
are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein. 
70. 
As discussed, AS from his living situation as a roommate with Plaintiff’s 
Principal, Yasha, he inquired about the success of Plaintiff’s business and gained that 
information by representing to Yasha, Plaintiff’s principal verbally in a face to face 
conversation in the Summer of 2017 that he would keep the information confidential 
and would not use it to start a competing business.  
71. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that AS always 
intended to use the information provided by Yasha, Plaintiff’s principal, to start a 
competing business, and knew all along that his representations to Yasha were false.    
72. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that over the next 
few months, TB, AS, and FKG carried out the above-mentioned misappropriation. 
73. 
TB, AS, and FKG knew such representations were false and intended 
that Plaintiff rely upon them given their plan to misappropriate the information under 
the guise of an interested and loyal roommate. 
74. 
 Plaintiff was unaware that the above-referenced representations were 
false, and Plaintiff could not, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered 
them. 
75. 
Given the very close relationship between and among roommates, 
Plaintiff reasonably relied on the above-referenced representations. 
76. 
 It was only after Defendants were found to be copying the CC Work and

TB, AS, and FKG were visiting Plaintiff's websites daily that Plaintiff became aware 
of the deceit. 
77. 
 As a direct and proximate cause of the above-referenced representations, 
and Plaintiff’s reasonable reliance thereon, Plaintiff was harmed by the 
misappropriation of the information.   
78. 
 As a direct and proximate result of the misappropriation, Plaintiff has 
been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $1,000,000. 
79. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the aforesaid 
conduct of Defendants was part of an act of intentional deceit with the intention and 
effect of causing Plaintiff loss and injury, in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights 
and interest, so as to justify an award of punitive damages. 
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
BREACH OF IMPLIED CONTRACT  
(Against All Defendants) 
80. 
All of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through 79 above 
are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein. 
81. 
As set forth above, AS inquired of his roommate of over five years, 
Yasha, a principal of Plaintiff, as to the inner-workings of Plaintiff and its success in 
the market. 
82. 
Based upon the trust one acquires in a roommate of over five years, 
Plaintiff’s principal disclosed to AS the information being asked about.  However, as 
an offer in order to provide the information, Plaintiff’s principal made it clear to AS 
that such information was confidential and proprietary, and the information could not 
be used, by AS or any future partners, to start a business that would compete with 
Plaintiff, or, otherwise, Plaintiff would have to be paid by AS, or his partners, for the 
use of such information. 
83. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that AS accepted, 
acknowledged, and agreed with the conditions for disclosure of the information.

84. 
Plaintiff’s principal answered AS’ questions and provided the 
information central to Plaintiff’s success. 
85. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that AS and his 
partners, TB and KFG, breached the agreement made with Plaintiff’s principal and

86. 
Plaintiff has suffered damages in the form of lost income from the 
Defendants’ breach, which is currently unknown but will be determined at trial.   
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
FEDERAL TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AND COUNTERFEITING 
(15 U.S.C. § 1114) 
(Against All Defendants) 
87. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 - 86 of this 
Complaint as if set forth fully herein.  
88. 
This is a claim for trademark infringement and counterfeiting arising 
under 15 U.S.C. § 1114. 
89. 
As set forth above Defendants have engaged in acts of direct 
infringement by the use of the Mark without Plaintiff’s consent. 
90. 
As set forth above, Defendants, and each of them, are directly liable for 
the direct acts of infringement committed by them. 
91. 
Upon information and belief, long after Plaintiff’s adoption and use of 
the Mark, Defendants have adopted and used in commerce identical or confusingly 
similar versions of the Mark without Plaintiff’s consent in a manner that infringes 
upon Plaintiff’s rights in the Mark in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1114. 
92. 
Without Plaintiff’s consent, Defendants used, and are using in commerce 
A mark that is confusingly similar to the Mark in connection with the promotion, 
marketing, advertising of their product in a manner which is likely to cause confusion, 
or to cause mistake, or to deceive.

 (213) 623-6546 
 
93. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants 
did so with actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s ownership and prior use of the Mark, and 
with the intent to unfairly compete with Plaintiff, to trade upon Plaintiff’s reputation 
and goodwill by causing confusion and mistake among customers and the public, and 
to deceive the public into believing that Defendants’ product is associated with, 
sponsored by, originate from, or are approved by Plaintiff, when it is not. 
94. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants’ 
activities constitute willful and intentional infringement and counterfeiting of the 
Mark, directly and/or indirectly, in total disregard of Plaintiff’s proprietary rights, and 
were done despite Defendants’ knowledge that the use of the Mark was and is in direct 
contravention of Plaintiff’s rights. 
95. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants 
have derived and received, and will continue to derive and receive, gains, profits, and 
advantages from the use of the Mark in an amount that is not presently known to 
Plaintiff. By reason of Defendants’ actions, constituting unauthorized use of the Mark, 
Plaintiff has been damaged and is entitled to monetary relief in an amount to be 
determined at trial.  
96. 
Due to Defendants’ actions, constituting unauthorized use of the Mark, 
Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer great and irreparable injury, for which 
Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. 
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
FEDERAL UNFAIR COMPETITION & FALSE DESIGNATION OF 
ORIGIN 
(15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)) 
(Against All Defendants) 
97. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-96 of this 
Complaint as if set forth fully herein.

99. 
As set forth above Defendants have engaged in acts of direct 
infringement by the use of the Mark without Plaintiff’s consent. 
100. Defendants’ direct and indirect use of the Mark without Plaintiff’s 
consent constitutes a false designation of origin, false or misleading description of 
fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which is likely to cause confusion,

are in some way affiliated or connected with Plaintiff, when they are not, all in 
violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). 
103. Upon information and belief, Defendants’ actions were undertaken 
willfully with full knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin and false 
descriptions or representations.

have derived and received, and will continue to derive and receive, gains, profits, and 
advantages from Defendants’ false designation of origin, false or misleading

DEFENSES

Defendant asserts the following affirmative defenses to the Complaint. By 
designating the following defenses as affirmative, Defendant does not concede that it 
bears the burden of proof with respect to any such defense and does not intend to alter 
the burden of proof on such matters to the extent the burden rests on Plaintiff. Further, 
12 
Defendant does not concede that any of the claims asserted in the Complaint have merit.

47. 
Rittersbacher is the owner of the real property located at 8300 West Sunset 
15 Boulevard, West Hollywood, California 90069 (""Subject Property""). The Subject 
16 Property is located in the heart of the Sunset Strip and was the site of the Standard 
17 Hollywood Hotel until its closure in January 2021. 
18 
48. 
Rittersbacher previously leased the Subject Property to Golden Crest, Inc. 
19 (""GCI"") pursuant to a written ground lease, dated July 9, 1959 (""Ground Lease""), who 
20 in-tum subleased the commercial structure thereon to Ferrado Hollywood, LLC 
21 (""Ferrado""). Ferrado operated the Hotel at all relevant times through its affiliate, 
22 HotelCrafters Hollywood, LLC. 
23 
49. 
The Ground Lease provided that any sublease of the Subject Property 
24 required Rittersbacher' s consent. Despite this, GCI purportedly subleased a small pad 
25 on the northwest comer of the Subject Property to Melven Genser Outdoor Advertising, 
26 Inc. (""Genser"") pursuant to that certain Billboard Lease (without Rittersbacher's 
27 knowledge), where Genser operated an existing billboard structure until it sold its rights 
28 in the Billboard Lease to Outdoor Specialists, LLC. Outdoor was later dissolved and

The Billboard Lease according to its terms was to expire in 2021. 
51. 
On September 12, 2019, GCI and Osik entered into that certain Amendment 
to Billboard Lease (""Amendment"") purporting to extend the term of to 2027, again 
without the approval or consent of Defendant. However, the Amendment provided that: 
Lessee [Osik] acknowledges that Lessor's [GCI's] rights in the 
Property are derived through a ground lease under which Lessor 
is the ground lessee. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that if 
for any reason the ground lease is terminated, neither Lessor 
nor any of Lessor's officers, directors, shareholders, employees, 
agents, contractors or representative shall have any liability to 
Lessee and all rights of Lessee under the Lease shall 
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect 
contemporaneous with termination of said ground lease. 
52. 
The Amendment is unequivocal that GCI does not own the Subject 
17 Property. Osik's principal understood that paragraph to mean that the Billboard Lease 
18 would end at the same time as the Ground Lease. 
19 
53. 
In or around April 2019, the City of West Hollywood began a program to 
20 facilitate the installation of digital signage on the Sunset Strip. As a prerequisite to 
21 issuance of the permits that would be necessary to build and operate a digital sign, the 
22 City required application for permission to do so. Such approval was referred to in the 
23 program as a ""Concept Award."" If an application received a Concept Award it would be 
24 permitted to file an application for a permit to install and maintain a digital display sign 
25 
upon their property located on the Sunset Strip. 
26 
27 
54. 
Osik and its now admitted partner, New Tradition Media, submitted an 
application for a Concept Award, on or about November 4, 2019. Included in the

materials submitted to the City of West Hollywood was a 2-D depiction of a proposed

1 sign concept which Plaintiff now claims are subject to a copyright owned by Plaintiff, 
2 Osik and their architect. In the materials submitted to the City of West Hollywood no 
3 reference to any copyright protection was included or asserted. The application was 
4 submitted without Rittersbacher' s knowledge or consent. And, in doing so, the 
5 application falsely stated in the owner of the Subject Property was: ""The Standard Hotel: 
6 8300 West Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood [sic] California [sic] 90069."" And that it 
7 had the owner's permission to file the application. This false statement was made under 
8 
9 
10 
penalty of perjury. 
55. 
Awards and permits for use of real property in the City of West Hollywood 
issued under the City's program are not issued to sign operators. Instead, they constitute 
11 
entitlements running with the land, and are issued to the real property where the use will 
12 
be exercised and its owners. In line with this, when a prospective operator does not own 
13 
14 the property upon which they intend to install a digital sign, the City of West Hollywood 
15 requires that the application be signed by the property owner and an affirmation that 
16 consent and approval has been given to the applicant to submit the application. 
17 
56. 
When the City of West Hollywood learned of the misrepresentation, they 
18 ceased dealing with Osik and New Tradition Media and contacted Defendant 
19 Rittersbacher and informed it that it and not Osik or New Tradition was recognized by 
20 the City of West Hollywood as holder of all rights pertaining to the installation of a 
21 digital display sign at the Subject Property. 
22 
57. 
On September 3, 2021, GCI and Ferrado surrendered the Subject Property 
23 and terminated the Master Lease. Immediately thereafter, Defendant undertook efforts 
24 to sell the Subject Property. 
Despite the language of the Amendment and despite 
25 assurances that it would surrender the premises, Osik refused to do so. Defendant 
26 Rittersbacher is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that Plaintiff New 
27 Tradition orchestrated Osik's change in position. Instead of vacating the Subject 
28 Property they sought to extract financial and legal concessions to which they were not

58. 
In April 2022, Defendant Rittersbacher entered into a purchase and sale 
agreement for the sale of the Subject Property. After that time Plaintiff New Tradition 
and Osik continued their efforts to extract a financial settlement, as well as an agreement 
to enter into a new lease for a billboard at the Subject Property. As part of their coercive 
efforts, New Tradition and Osik claimed that they have and had the right to a portion of 
the sales price for the Subject Property that they attribute to the Concept Award. They 
maintain their claims despite the fact that the Concept A ward does not represent the right 
12 
to actually build or install anything. No approval has been given by the City to permit 
13 
a digital display sign and no building permits have been issued. New Tradition and Osik 
14 
15 have attempted to use these claims to interfere with the pending sale of the Subject 
16 Property to third parties and have in fact interfered with the closing of the purchase and 
17 sale transaction. 
18 
59. 
As a result of their interference, New Tradition and Osik have delayed the 
19 closing of the transaction and caused financial harm to Defendant Rittersbacher. 
20 Defendant Rittersbacher filed suit on June 3, 2022, in the Los Angeles Superior Court in 
21 the action entitled Rittersbacher Sunset LLC vs. Osik Media, LLC, bearing Case Number 
22 22SMCV (""State Action""). In response, Plaintiffs partner, Osik, filed a cross-complaint 
23 asserting that it was entitled to compensation for the ""regulatory jackpot"" it hit with the 
24 Concept A ward and specifically referenced the Copyright Materials in its cross-
25 complaint and demanded compensation of $20,000,000, thus continuing in the scheme 
26 of New Tradition and Osik to obtain monies from Defendant Rittersbacher that they were 
27 not entitled to. A true and correct copy of the Cross-complaint is attached hereto as 
28 Exhibit A. During the pendency of that action, on October 19, 2022, Defendant's

1 intention of naming New Tradition as a defendant were disclosed. On December 15, 
2 2022, Plaintiff New Tradition was named as a defendant in that action.

60. 
On November 16, 2022, counsel for Plaintiff submitted a letter advising 
4 counsel for Defendant Rittersbacher that a copyright registration had been issued by the 
5 United States Copyright Office. A true and correct copy of said letter is attached hereto 
6 as Exhibit B, and incorporated herein by reference as though set forth in full. The letter 
7 
8 
9 
10 
does not identify when the application was submitted to the Copyright Office and it does 
not identify when the copyright registration was issued. A review of the registration 
revealed that the application was first submitted to the Copyright Office on July 11, 
2022, (which was one month after Defendant Rittersbacher filed an action for unlawful 
11 
detainer to remove Osik from the Subject Premises) and that the registration was issued 
12 
on November 2, 2022, just two weeks before sending the November 16, 2022, letter. 
13 
14 
61. 
The registration was solely for a 2-D representation of a billboard that was 
15 submitted to the City of West Hollywood as part of Plaintiff's and Osik's application for 
16 a Concept Award. It did not purport to include any rights to construct or restrict the 
17 construction of any billboard at the Subject Property. 
18 
62. 
In response to Exhibit B, counsel Plaintiff submitted a letter on November 
19 28, 2022, setting forth that Defendant Rittersbacher never intended to make use of the 
20 Copyright Material, regardless of any copyrights asserted by Plaintiff and that there was 
21 no intent to do so in the future. A true and correct copy of said letter is attached hereto 
22 as Exhibit C. That letter unequivocally states that Defendant Rittersbacher never stated 
23 or represented that it could or would transfer any of the Copyright Material to any person 
24 and that it did not intend to do so in the future. Counsel for Defendant Rittersbacher 
25 went on to advise Plaintiff's counsel that the depictions in the Copyright Materials could 
26 not be used and were useless. In particular, the contents of the Copyright Material 
27 depicted a billboard that transgressed onto real property that was owned by the County 
28 of Los Angeles and not within the jurisdiction of the City of West Hollywood.

As a result of the pendency of the State Action, an adjudication in this 
proceeding will be unnecessary and inappropriate. The Court should elect to abstain 
from rendering a declaratory action and refrain from issuing any injunctive orders in this 
action. 
FIFTH DEFENSE 
(Lack of Need for Declaratory Relief) 
69. 
Plaintiffs' claims are barred in whole or in part because Plaintiffs have 
13 failed to mitigate the, if any. Plaintiffs are, for example, well aware of the ability to 
14 request the removal from Y ouTube of allegedly infringing content using the process set 
15 forth in the DMCA. To the extent Plaintiffs failed to employ that process with respect to 
16 specific allegedly infringing material on the Y ouTube service, Plaintiffs have failed to

SIXTH DEFENSE 
(Failure to Attach Copyright Material) 
70. 
Plaintiff has failed to attach to the complaint a full and complete copy of 
21 the asserted Copyright Registration, including its deposit material submission to the 
22 United States Copyright office and therefore this Court is precluded from entering 
23 judgment in favor of Plaintiff.

Any alleged use of any copyright material, if there was any, does not

(Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel)

79. 
Central to its claims in this action is that they are entitled to benefits derived 
15 from the City of West Hollywood's granting of permission for the owner of the Subject 
16 Property to apply for a permit to install and maintain a digital display sign at that 
17 Property. As the City of West Hollywood has recognized in its official records that 
18 Defendant Rittersbacher is the sole party with lawful rights to pursue and obtain such 
19 permission, this Court is precluded from adjudicating those rights. In addition, Plaintiff 
20 has failed to challenge, appeal or seek reconsideration of the actions of the City of West 
21 Hollywood. [the unlawful detainer action - they claimed rights re copyright material -

(Functional and Generic Design)

The alleged Copyright Material contains functional and generic depictions 
and are not enforceable in this action. 
TWENTIETH DEFENSE 
(Lack of Standing/Misjoinder) 
84. 
The Complaint admits that others claim to own a portion of the rights to the

18 plaintiffs or defendants, there is a misjoinder that precludes granting of relief in this

(Substantial Non-Infringing Use)

Defendant/Cross-Complainant Osik Media, LLC (""Osik"") cross-complains against 
2 Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Rittersbacher Sunset, LLC (""RSL"") as follows: 
3 
4 
1. 
NATURE OF THIS CROSS-COMPLAINT 
RSL owns the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, where Osik 
5 operates a billboard under a sublease (the Billboard Lease). RSL leased the property to an entity 
6 called Golden Crest, Inc. (GCI), which was Osik's sublessor. In early 2019, the City established an 
7 Arts and Advertising Program for the placement of electronic billboards on the Sunset Strip, where 
8 the property is located. Osik and a partner entity applied for design approval for a 989-square foot 
9 digital billboard and a new static sign on the property. RSL paid no attention to Osik's activities, and 
IO Osik was unaware of RSL's existence until its application was nearly completed. On March 23, 
11 2021, the City granted Osik's application and issued a design excellence award for property. The 
12 award doubled the value of the property from an appraised $60-70 million in 2020 to an agreed sale 
13 price of $120 million in late 2021. 
14 
2. 
RSL then sought to kick Osik off the property and take all the benefit of Osik's 
15 design approval. Litigation erupted in 2020 between RSL and GCI over the rent GCI was to pay. In 
16 September 2021, RSL and GCI entered into a contractual termination of GCI's lease. RSL then 
17 demanded that Osik vacate the premises. RSL argued that under a 2019 Amendment, the Billboard 
18 Lease terminated along with the GCI lease. Osik disputes RSL 's termination arguments, and RSL 
19 has sought to pressure Osik to leave by filing this lawsuit for what is now about $9 million in 
20 damages. 
21 
3. 
By this Cross-Complaint Osik seeks three types of relief: ( 1) a declaratory judgment 
22 that the Billboard Lease remains in full effect through the end of its term in 2027; alternatively, if it 
23 must give up possession of its billboard, Osik seeks (2) part of the $50-60 million Osik added to the 
24 property; and (3) damages for RSL's interference with the Billboard Lease. 
25 
26 
4. 
THE PARTIES 
At all relevant times, RSL was and is a limited liability company organized and 
27 existing under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Springfield, 
28 Oregon. At all relevant times, RSL was the owner of the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West

Hollywood. The property is the site of the Hollywood Standard Hotel ( closed in January 2021) and a 
2 billboard Osik operates under the Billboard Lease. 
3 
5. 
At all relevant times, Osik was and is a limited liability company organized and 
4 existing under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Altadena, 
5 California, in Los Angeles County. 
6 
6. 
Osik does not know the true names of defendants DOES 1 through 10, and therefore 
7 sues them by those fictitious names. Osik is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 
8 each of those defendants was in some manner legally responsible for the events and happenings 
9 alleged in this complaint and for Osik's injury as alleged herein. The names, capacities, and 
10 relationships of DOES 1 through 10 will be alleged by amendment to this complaint when they are 
11 known. 
12 
7. 
Osik is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all times mentioned in 
13 this complaint, defendants were the agents and employees of their codefendants, and in doing the 
14 things alleged in this complaint were acting within the course and scope of that agency and 
I 5 employment. 
16 
17 
8. 
FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION 
In 1959, the predecessors-in-interest of RSL and GCI entered into a 99-year master 
18 Ground Lease. At all times relevant to this Cross-Complaint, GCI was the master lessor. Paragraph 
19 3 of the Ground Lease called for a rent adjustment every 20 years. The rent was to be 8% of the 
20 value of the property. 
21 
9. 
Beginning on or about April 5, 2001, a billboard was operated on the property under 
22 the Billboard Lease. The original billboard sublessee was Melven Genser Outdoor, Inc. (""Genser""), 
23 which operated the billboard until about May 1, 2010. At that time, Osik's predecessor-in-interest, 
24 Outdoor Specialists, LLC (""OSL""), bought the billboard structure and Genser's rights under the 
25 Billboard Lease. Osik was formed in the expectation that a partner would join OS L's principal Nick 
26 Petralia in a business that included OSL's. That did not happen, but having announced the formation 
27 of Osik, Mr. Petralia conducted the business of OSL under the Osik name. OSL was dissolved in 
28 2017.

10. 
By a September 12, 2019 Amendment between GCI and Osik, the term of the 
2 Billboard Lease, which otherwise would have expired in 2021, was extended to December 31, 2027. 
3 The Amendment further provided (i-1 4) that GCI's rights in the property derive from the Ground 
4 Lease. And ""if for any reason the ground lease is terminated ... all rights of Lessee under the 
5 [Billboard] Lease shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect contemporaneous 
6 with termination"" of the Ground Lease. 
7 
11. 
OSL began operating the billboard under a Purchase and Assignment Agreement 
8 with Genser on or about May 1, 2010. On September 12, 2019, Osik and GCI entered into an 
9 Amendment of the Billboard Lease. The billboard was an open and notorious use of the property. At 
10 all relevant times, RSL therefore had imputed knowledge of the billboard and the Billboard Lease. 
11 In 2016, RSL's principal Randy Garrity saw the billboard but made no effort to determine who was 
12 operating it or to learn about the Billboard Lease. The property leased under the Billboard Lease was 
13 only the billboard itself, which was an improvement to the property. Paragraph 18 of the Ground 
14 Lease provided that the landlord's consent was not necessary for subleases of improvements. At no 
15 time did RSL notify Osik that it was terminating the Billboard Lease for lack of consent. 
16 
12. 
In 2019, a dispute arose between RSL and GCI about how the property was to be 
17 valued for adjustment of the Ground Lease rent. In the 60 years the Ground Lease had been in 
18 effect, conditions had changed dramatically. The 8300 property was now worth more as raw land 
19 than it was with the hotel and other improvements on it. Under RSL's valuation approach, which 
20 excluded the improvements, an appraiser valued the property at $61 million. Under GCI/F's 
21 approach, which valued the property as a leased fee, the value was $11 million. The resulting rent 
22 disparity was about $4.9 million under RSL's formula vs. $880,000 under GCI's. 
23 
13. 
The parties were unable to resolve their dispute and filed suit against each other. On 
24 May 28, 2020, RSL sued GCI, seeking a judicial determination that its adjustment formula was the 
25 correct one. On July 9, 2020, CGI's hotel sublessee Ferrado Hollywood, LLC brought an action 
26 challenging the RSL appraiser's method. On December 4, 2020, the court issued an interim adopting 
27 RSL's valuation method.

DEFENDANT AND CROSS-COMPLAINANT OSIK MEDIA'S CROSS-COMPLAINT 
Case 2:22-cv-08670-WLH-AS     Document 14     Filed 01/10/23     Page 22 of 36   Page ID
#:92
14. 
By February 2021, RSL claimed a total of over $6 million in unpaid rent. But RSL 
2 didn't take the obvious step to terminate the Ground Lease. To effect a forfeiture of a lease for 
3 nonpayment of rent the landlord must serve the tenant with a notice to pay or quit. If the rent is due 
4 and owing and remains unpaid at the end of the notice period, a cause of forfeiture arises. But no 
5 cause of forfeiture arises without such a notice. The minimum such notice is three days. Paragraph 
6 
19 of the Ground Lease required 15 days' notice. Moreover, nonpayment ofrent is a curable breach. 
7 RSL thus was required to serve a pay-or-quit notice on Osik as well as GCI and Ferrado RSL never 
8 served a pay-or-quit notice on GCI/F or Osik. 
9 
15. 
RSL claims that GCI and Ferrado (collectively ""GCI/F"") could not pay the rent under 
10 the court-ordered formula and refused to do so. But GCI/F asserted defenses to RSL's rent claim. 
11 First, City and County rent moratoria prohibited eviction of commercial tenants for nonpayment of 
12 rent that accrued after about March 2020. GCI/F also claimed a force majeure defense to their 
13 obligations under the Ground Lease, including payment ofrent, due to Covid and its severe effects 
14 on hotels, restaurants, and bars, i.e., the types of business operated at the Standard Hotel. GCI/F had 
15 other defenses as well, including modification of the Ground Lease due to radically changed 
16 circumstances (the property now being more valuable without improvements) and possible 
17 reorganization in bankruptcy. The prospect of a digital sign on the property provided a potential 
18 income stream to pay the new rent. These defenses were never litigated or resolved. The litigation 
19 did not produce a final judgment. Instead, the parties settled in June 2021 for the usual reasons, i.e., 
20 to avoid further litigation and the costs of legal proceedings to obtain possession of the Property. 
21 
16. 
Meanwhile, in 2019 Osik submitted a design-approval application for a digital sign 
22 and a new static billboard to be placed on the property. Osik openly disclosed its application efforts, 
23 which cost over $125,000, to GCI, which Osik reasonably believed to own the property. 
24 
17. 
On March 26, 2021, Osik hit the regulatory jackpot by obtaining a design excellence 
25 award for the signs from the City. Although further discretionary City approvals were required, the 
26 award is the main hurdle in obtaining a permit for a digital sign. RSL says so itself in its marketing 
27 material for the property. Osik has a two-year window, until March 26, 2023, to submit a completed 
28 application. To do so, Osik needs owner approval, which RSL refuses to provide.

#:93
18. 
On September 3, 2021, RSL and GCI entered into an agreement (""the Termination 
2 Agreement"") in which they agreed to dismiss the litigation and terminate the Ground Lease. The 
3 litigation ended without a judicial finding that GCI had breached the Ground Lease or that RSL had 
4 the right to terminate the Ground Lease or regain possession of the property. On or about September 
5 13, 2021, RSL gave Osik notice of the Termination Agreement. RSL sent Osik a proposed short-
6 term sublease but did not demand that Osik surrender possession. 
7 
19. 
In about October 2021, having terminated the Ground Lease and - in its view -
8 disposed of the Billboard Lease, RSL put the property on the market. RSL's broker CBRE issued a 
9 sales flyer on the internet touting the design approval Osik obtained as a full permit: ""Although the 
10 site contains an existing income generating static billboard, the City of West Hollywood has 
11 awarded 8300 Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage."" The market reaction to the 
12 design approval was spectacular. In late 2021, RSL and a buyer agreed on a sale price of $120 
13 million, approximately double the property's appraised value a year earlier. 
14 
20. 
After the Termination Agreement, Osik sought to reach a long-term lease with RSL 
15 to operate the digital sign and a new static sign on the property. RSL asked for and Osik provided 
16 information on the revenue produced by the existing billboard, which RSL used in its sale 
17 negotiations. In December 2021, as RSL's demands to vacate continued, it appeared that RSL would 
18 not enter into a lease. Osik had never agreed that the Billboard Lease was terminated. In December 
19 2021, Osik cited case law to RSL that in Osik's view holds that the Termination Agreement left the 
20 Billboard Lease intact. 
21 
21. 
On January 14, 2022, RSL filed an unlawful detainer (UD) action against Osik as a 
22 limited case. The UD case is pending. On June 7, 2022, RSL filed this action for $5 million in 
23 damages, plus an additional $1 million a month and punitive damages.

23. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Declaratory Relief) 
Osik incorporates 11 1-22 by reference as thought fully set forth herein. 
An actual controversy has arisen between the parties in relation to Osik's rights under 
28 the Billboard Lease. Osik contends that the Billboard Lease remains fully valid and in effective.

DEFENDANT AND CROSS-COMPLAINANT OSIK MEDIA'S CROSS-COMPLAINT 
Case 2:22-cv-08670-WLH-AS     Document 14     Filed 01/10/23     Page 24 of 36   Page ID
#:94
Osik further contends that even if the Billboard Lease were terminated, Osik retains ownership of 
2 the sign structure and has the right to remove it. RSL contends that the Billboard Lease has 
3 terminated has is of no further effect, and on information and belief contends that Osik has no 
4 property rights in the sign structure. 
5 
24. 
A judicial determination of the parties' rights in the Billboard Lease and the 
6 billboard is necessary and appropriate at this time so that the parties can conduct themselves in 
7 conformity with law. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
25. 
26. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Unjust Enrichment) 
Osik incorporates ,i,i 1-20 by reference as thought fully set forth herein.5 
Osik contends that it is entitled to remain in possession of the billboard through the 
12 full term of the Billboard Lease at the end of 2027. In the alternative, if Osik must give up 
13 possession, it seeks monetary compensation for the undeserved windfall benefit RSL has received 
14 from the preliminary design approval Osik obtained. RSL marketed the property on the basis that a 
15 digital sign could be operated on the property. The revenue potential of such a sign is $5-7 million a 
16 year and perhaps more. As a result of Osik's design approval, the value of the property went from an 
17 appraised range of $61-75 million in 2020-2021 to over $120 million in late 2021. RSL claims that 
18 in late 2021, it entered into a ""binding contract"" to sell the property for $120 million. 
19 
27. 
RSL in justice should not be allowed to retain the full benefit Osik obtained for the 
20 property. At all times, Osik acted in good faith, in the honest and reasonable belief that it had all 
21 owner approvals necessary to proceed with the design approval application and subsequently a 
22 development agreement with the City for a digital and new static sign on the property. Until near the 
23 end of the design application process, Osik believed GCI was the property owner. Throughout the 
24 design approval process in 2019-2021, RSL was charged with knowledge of Osik's efforts, which 
25 were reflected in publicly available documents and discussed in open City hearings. But RSL chose 
26 not to find out, or to ignore, Osik's efforts. 
27 
28. 
When RSL gained actual knowledge of Osik's design application, on March 18, 2021 
28 -with all the work done and a decision by the City only a week away - RSL's lawyer wrote to Osik 
6

saying that RSL did not authorize any permitting activity by Osik and Osik would proceed at its own 
2 risk. Osik, however, had already proceeded. There was nothing left for Osik to do but await the 
3 City's decision. 
4 
29. 
When the City's decision issued, RSL appropriated it as RSL's own and beginning 
5 later in 2021 decided to get rid of Osik and sell the property as a site for a digital sign. As alleged 
6 above, RSL emphasized in its sales material that the property had received a design excellence 
7 award from the City. As a result, the value of the property skyrocketed due to Osik's efforts that 
8 RSL now seeks to take for itself, leaving Osik with nothing. 
9 
30. 
The Court should order that RSL pay to Osika reasonable share of the additional 
10 value of the property Osik created, in an amount of $20,000,000. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
31. 
32. 
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Intentional Interference with Contract) 
Osik incorporates ,r,r 
1-29 above as though fully set forth herein. 
As of 2010, Osik had an existing, fully valid sublease, i.e., the Billboard Lease, with 
15 GCI. RSL knew of the Billboard Lease. RSL had constructive notice since 2001 when the billboard 
16 - which was certainly an open and notorious use - went up on the property. By its own admission, 
17 RSL's principal Randy Garrity had actual notice of the billboard in 2016, which implied the 
18 existence of the Billboard Lease. By RSL's further admission, it learned of the Billboard Lease via 
19 an email from GCI/F's counsel in March 2021. RSL thus knew that Osik was a subtenant. 
20 
33. 
The Billboard Lease contained implied covenants that required GCI to maintain the 
21 Ground Lease through the full term of the Billboard Lease, which ran through December 31, 2027. 
22 Beginning in early 2021, RSL intentionally interfered with the Billboard Lease by inducing GCI to 
23 breach it by purporting to terminate the Ground Lease, thereby in RSL's view terminating the 
24 Billboard Lease under ,r 4 of the 2019 Amendment. 
25 
34. 
As a direct and proximate result of RS L's conduct, GCI entered into the Termination 
26 Agreement, which allowed RSL to claim that the Billboard Lease was terminated. 
27 
35. 
As a direct and proximate result of RSL's wrongful conduct, Osik has been damaged 
28 in an amount of over $3 million in lost revenue on the existing static sign. 
7

#:96
36. 
RSL's conduct was intentional and designed specifically to destroy Osik's Billboard 
2 Lease and appropriate the Billboard Lease and the design approval for RSL. RSL further acted in 
3 conscious disregard of Osik's right to notice of any claim that GCI/F had defaulted in payment of 
4 rent or any other covenant of the Ground Lease. RSL deliberately deprived Osik of the opportunity 
5 to save the Ground Lease by pursuing a development agreement for the digital sign or otherwise. 
6 RSL thus acted maliciously and in conscious disregard for Osik's legal rights. Osik therefore is 
7 entitled to an award of punitive damages according to proof.

This firm represents New Tradition Media (""New Tradition""). We write on behalf of New 
Tradition, and with the permission of Osik Media, LLC (""Osik"") as well as Studio AR+D 
Architects, Inc. (""AR+D""). New Tradition, Osik and AR+D jointly own the above-referenced 
copyright, the title of which is ""The Digital Billboard."" (hereinafter, the ""Copyright""). The 
Copyright encompasses the design for a digital billboard and a new static sign and other related 
elements to be constructed at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, and adjacent property in 
Los Angeles. Hereinafter, the property at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. is referred to as the ""real property."" 
As described during the July 8, 2022 deposition taken in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 
22SMUD00094, for which Bret Richheimer provided testimony, Osik and New Tradition 
submitted certain design elements to the City of West Hollywood in 2019 as part of a design 
excellence screening application for new offsite signage. On March 26 2021, the City of West 
Hollywood issued a concept award based on the elements of the Copyright, including the ""creative 
vertical format and interesting dimensionality of the sign face,"" the ""elegant sign structure and 
associated sculptural connection to Hart Park,"" and the ""proposed public benefit improvements to 
Hart Park, including the physical connection and landscape materials"" (hereinafter the ""Concept 
Award""). The Concept Award is based, in part, on the elements that constitute the Copyright. 
Regardless of any ownership rights in the Concept Award conferred by the City of West 
Hollywood, the Copyright is wholly and jointly owned by New Tradition, Osik and AR+D.

The Copyright Act provides that Copyright owners have the exclusive right to reproduce 
copyrighted works, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies, to display the work and, 
among others, to license and assign the Copyright to others. The Copyright owners have not 
granted a valid license or otherwise transferred any rights in or to the Copyright to Rittersbacher 
Sunset, LLC (""RSL"") or any of RSL's agents, including but not limited to any right to reproduce, 
publish, provide, distribute, transmit, display, or otherwise make use of any portion of the 
Copyright. 
We are informed and believe that RSL has wrongfully used the Copyright in an effort to sell its 
real property at an elevated price that necessarily incorporates the Copyright as part of the sale. 
We are further informed and believe that during October 2021, RSL directed or otherwise 
authorized its real estate broker to publish a sales brochure stating that ""the City of West 
Hollywood has awarded 8300 Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage."" (See, 
www.8300sunset.com) The statement is a misrepresentation. Any rights conferred by the City of 
West Hollywood's Concept Award do not include granting rights that encompass the Copyright. 
If the allegation in RSL's Complaint in LASC Case No. 22SMCV00828, filed June 3, 2022 is to 
be believed, RSL has entered into an agreement for the sale of the real property at the value of 
""approximately $120 million"", which is almost double the valuation of the real property cited 
within RSL's May 28, 2020 Petition filed in LASC Case No. 20SMCP00165. By advertising the 
Copyrighted design, without a valid license, and falsely representing that RSL could transfer to a 
buyer of the real property certain intellectual property in addition thereto, it appears that RSL has 
and continues to engage in willful copyright infringement, which results in actual or statutory 
damages. 
Unless RSL presents a valid license before November 22, 2022, the Copyright owners expect RSL 
will do the following: 
I. Immediately cease representing that RSL owns and/or has sufficient right to any of the 
design elements encompassed within the Copyright, or any reproductions or works derived 
therefrom; 
2. Immediately inform any buyer(s) (actual or proposed) of the real property that such 
acquisition excludes the Copyright; 
3. Immediately remove any statements from the internet, any online data rooms, or other 
digital media all claims that RSL owns, holds or otherwise possesses the right to use, 
license or assign any element encompassed within the Copyright; 
4. Provide the Copyright owners with a full accounting of any revenue RSL has realized by 
using any element of the Copyright. 
We request that RSL expressly advise of its intent to comply with the above requests.

Re: 
Copyright No. VA0002326025/20?2-07-
l I 
Dear Ms. Corley, 
As you are aware, the undersigned represents Rittersbacher Sunset. LLC ( .. RSL ··), the owner of 
the real property located at 8300 Sunset Boulevard in the City of West Hollywood (the 
'·Property."" I am in receipt of your letter of November 16. 2022 and your email of November 19, 
2022 enclosing a copy of the document you registered with the United States Copyright Office 
(the ""Filing'""), referenced above. 
After reviewing both. it appears that you have been 
misinformed as to the true facts and circumstances surrounding the City of West Hollywood·s 
digital sign program and our client's, Rittersbacher Sunset, LLC., intentions in that regard. You 
also appear to misinterpret the legal rights related to issuance of discretionary municipal permits 
related to land use generally and with regard to digital billboards, specifically. 
Preliminarily, neither your client, New Tradition Media, nor its partner Osik Media, LLC 
(""Osik""), were entitled to apply for. let alone receive. a Concept Award under the Sunset Arts & 
Advertising Program. A tenant (let alone a sub-tenant at sufferance) has no rights to a land use 
entitlement in the City of West Hollywood (the ·•City""'). When issued, the rights derived from 
land use authorization ·'run with the land·· and grant rights solely to the property owner. 
It is 
clear from the rules and regulations of the City of West Hollywood that an applicant for a 
Concept Award, land use entitlement or construction permit can only be issued to the property 
owner and the property owner must expressly authorize such an application. 
The only reason that the application submitted by Osik was accepted by the City for 
consideration was the misrepresentation in the application that the property owner was Golden 
Crest, Inc. and that it had given consent to the filing of the application. Golden Crest is not and 
never was the owner of the property. RSL was never consulted or asked for its authorization to 
file such an application and did not do so. RSL was not even aware of your clients· illicit actions 
until the City informed them that they could not proceed without the authorization of the 
property owner. Once the City discovered the misrepresentation. it is my understanding that 
staff declined to deal further with your clients. The fact that the City could have voided the

application and instead elected to allow the landowner to continue can conjure no rights to your 
clients. 
The Concept Award does not constitute approval to do anything other than to apply for 
permission for a digital billboard. 
The Concept Award does not constitute approval of design 
and any design submitted would have to be approved by various elected and appointed officials 
of the City. And, the design as submitted with the application, in fact, cannot and never could be 
approved by the City. It is apparent that the designs proposed requires use of an adjacent park. 
That park, however, was not the property of West Hollywood and that the City could not issue 
any permits for the use of that property by your client. 
Once that element of the design is 
eliminated, all that is left is a rectangular sign similar to numerous other billboards on the Sunset 
Strip. I trust your client and its partner do not claim a propriety interest in a basic. rectangular 
geometric shape. 
Your letter suggests that your clients are entitled to exclusive use of the submission to the City of 
West Hollywood as a result of the Filing the United States Copyright Office. The Filing offers 
no support for your clients claims. A registration, often colloquially referred to as a copyright, 
actually grants no unique rights. Rather, it represents receipt by the Copyright Office of a claim 
to a particular fonn of expression. The Copyright Office does not evaluate or validate any claim 
to copyright. 
It simply confirms receipt of the proffered material in accordance with its 
procedural requirements. 
In this case, the Registration itself confim1s that it has no relevance to this matter. It reflects on 
its face that the application was submitted on July 11, 2022. The events to which you refer in 
your letter all preceded that dates. As such, the Filing has no bearing to our discussion. 
It is also notable that the timing of the registration coincides with events in the unlawful detainer 
and civil litigation between Osik and RSL. In particular, RSL • s complaint against Osik for 
damages was filed on June 3, 2022. Your registration was submitted the following month. It 
would appear that your client only decided to assert a copyright claim for tactical reasons and to 
further interfere with our clients pending sale of the Property and in furtherance of its efforts to 
illicitly extricate substantial sums from RSL. 
Even if a copyright to the materials existed, which is disputed by my client, there are exemptions 
in the law, too numerous to discuss here, that precludes its application under the circumstances 
presented. 
However, it is unnecessary to discuss them further at this time due to my clients 
response below to the questions posed in your letter. 
Without any legal obligation to do so, RSL, in order to avoid the waste of time and resources by 
all parties, responds to your questions, as follow: 
1. RSL has not and does not intend to represent that it owns the subject of the registration 
with the Copyright Office.

2. RSL has not and does not intend to represent to any person that it has the right to grant 
permission to build a billboard as depicted in the material submitted to the Copyright 
Office. 
3. No representations have been made that a sale of the Property would include the rights to 
copyrighted materials 
4. To our knowledge there are no statements on the internet, any online data rooms, or other 
digital media that RSL claims to own, hold or possess the right to use, license or assign 
the materials submitted to the Copyright Office. 
5. RSL has not and does not intend to construct a billboard based upon the materials 
submitted to the Copyright Otlice. 
Nothing herein shall be deemed an acknowledgment that your clients or those acting in concert 
with them, have any rights under the copyright laws of the United States or the State of 
California with respect to Materials. 
This contents of this letter are not an exhaustive or 
comprehensive list of my client's rights with regard to with respect to the alleged copyright 
material, its use of the Property, its legal rights or the remedies has with respect to your clients 
and its partners' conduct, including but not limited to their interference with the sale of the 
Property or the lawful processes of the City of West Hollywood. All rights and remedies are 
expressly reserved. 
I trust that the foregoing sufficiently addresses your client's unfounded belief that the Materials 
will be used without consent of its owners and resolved the questions raised in your letter. 
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
The Copyright 
11. 
New Tradition, Osik Media, LLC (""Osik""), and Studio AR+D Architects, 
Inc. (""AR+D"") are joint owners of the Copyright.  New Tradition, Osik, and AR+D 
are collectively referred to as the ""Copyright owners"". 
12. 
The Copyright encompasses the design for a digital billboard and a new 
static sign and other creative elements. The title of the Copyright is ""The Digital 
Billboard."" The effective date of registration of the Copyright is July 11, 2022; the 
Copyright registration decision date is November 2, 2022.  Attached as Exhibit A to 
this Complaint is a true and correct copy of the copyright registration of The Digital 
Billboard. 
13. 
Osik and New Tradition submitted all design elements encompassed by 
the Copyright (as well as additional components disclaimed by the Copyright owners) 
to the City of West Hollywood in 2019 as part of a design excellence screening 
application for new off-site advertising signage on Sunset Boulevard, which 
submission sought permission for the design to be constructed at the Subject Real 
Property. Attached as Exhibit B to this Complaint is a true and correct copy of 
materials submitted to the City of West Hollywood as part of the Sunset Boulevard 
off-site advertising signage program design excellence screening application. The 
materials at Exhibit B were also submitted to the United States Copyright Office for 
copyright registration of certain copyrightable aspects.  
14. 
 In submitting the materials to the City of West Hollywood, the 
Copyright owners neither transferred, conveyed, nor assigned any Copyright

ownership interest to the City of West Hollywood nor did the Copyright owners 
provide to the City of West Hollywood the right to license or sublicense the Copyright 
or any aspect of the content of the Copyright.  
15. 
On March 26, 2021, the City of West Hollywood approved the design 
excellence screening application submitted by Osik and New Tradition and granted a 
concept award based on said submission (""Concept Award""). Plaintiff does not claim 
ownership of or to the Concept Award. The Concept Award has the effect of allowing 
for submission of a formal application for new off-site advertising signage to the City 
of West Hollywood Department of Planning and Development Services at the Subject 
Real Property.  Pursuant to the terms of the Concept Award, any such submission of a 
formal application by way of the Concept Award would have to be consistent with the 
original submission Osik and New Tradition presented to the City of West Hollywood 
in 2019.  Importantly, the Concept Award itself does not convey any rights in or to the 
Copyright.   
16. 
The Copyright confers ownership of the entire copyrighted work, and all 
of its individual constituent elements to the Copyright owners, only. 
17. 
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 106, the Copyright owners have the exclusive 
right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute 
copies, and to display the work.  
18. 
Under 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(5) and (8), the Copyright also confers the right 
to prevent anyone from copying the originality of the copyrighted elements, creating 
derivative works based thereon or building any of the copyrighted elements. The 
copyrighted elements include the digital billboard and other elements of the 
Copyright, as well as any derivative work based on the Copyright. Only the Copyright 
owners (and those receiving permission from the Copyright owners) can use the 
copyrighted elements, or any derivative work based on the Copyright, to construct the 
copyrighted design, whether at the Subject Real Property or elsewhere.

Plaintiff has reserved all of its rights in the Copyright, and has not 
authorized Defendant or any of Defendant's agents to reproduce, publish, provide, 
distribute, transmit, display, or otherwise make use of any portion of the work 
encompassed by the Copyright.  
20. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes that neither Osik nor AR+D have 
authorized Defendant or any of Defendant's agents to reproduce, publish, provide, 
distribute, transmit, display, or otherwise make use of any portion of the work 
encompassed by the Copyright. 
B. 
Defendant's Improper Acts Regarding the Copyright 
21. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes that during or around 2021, Defendant 
listed the Subject Real Property for sale.  In so doing, Defendant wrongfully used 
some or all of the copyrighted work in offering the Subject Real Property for sale.  
22. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes that Defendant began marketing the 
Subject Real Property in 2021 for sale, and continues to do so. In so marketing, during 
October 2021, Plaintiff is informed and believes that Defendant authorized its real 
estate broker to create and publish a digital sales brochure and website in which 
Defendant references the Concept Award and, by extension, the Copyright. 
Specifically, Defendant falsely represents that ""the City of West Hollywood has 
awarded 8300 Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage""; Defendant's 
statement is a direct reference to the Concept Award, which is based on The Digital 
Billboard and Copyright. As earlier described, the Concept Award has the effect of 
allowing for submission of a formal application for new off-site advertising signage at 
the Subject Real Property. Pursuant to the terms of the Concept Award, any such 
application is required to include designs consistent with the 2019 submission to the 
City of West Hollywood made by Osik and New Tradition, and which designs are part 
of the Copyright. The Concept Award does not convey any ownership of rights to The 
Digital Billboard and Copyright, yet Defendant directly references the ability to install

TEL.: (213) 688-9500 – FAX: (213) 627-6342 
the digital billboard signage arising from an award from the City of West Hollywood 
and has done so absent permission from the Copyright owners. The Copyright owners 
have not and do not authorize Defendant and/or Defendant's agents or buyers of the 
Subject Real Property to utilize or obtain any interest, title, or right in or to the 
Copyright, including but not limited to the ability to utilize The Digital Billboard. 
23. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant seeks to significantly increase 
the sale price of the Subject Real Property by its false representations concerning the 
Concept Award, and by extension, Defendant's rights relative to the Copyright and 
ability to utilize or transfer rights in or to The Digital Billboard. Attached as Exhibit 
C to this Complaint is a true and correct copy of an online sales publication, which 
includes Defendant's false statement, ""the City of West Hollywood has awarded 8300 
Sunset with the ability to install digital billboard signage."" Attached as Exhibit D to 
this Complaint is a true and correct copy of a screenshot of the website marketing the 
Subject Real Property at https://www.8300sunset.com (last visited on Nov. 29, 2022), 
which similarly cites Defendant's false statement. 
24. 
Any rights conferred by the Concept Award, if any, including the right of 
Defendant to market to third parties exclude the rights held by the Copyright owners 
in their Copyright.  The Copyright owners exclusively hold any and all right, title, and 
interest in the Copyright and accordingly, the exclusive authority to license and/or 
assign such rights in or to the Copyright under the Copyright Act. The Copyright 
owners have not authorized Defendant to make any representations about the 
Copyright, including as to whether there will be any transfer of ownership rights in or 
grant of license to the Copyright by virtue of Defendant's sale of the Subject Real 
Property.  
25. 
Plaintiff is further informed and believes that in an online data room and 
elsewhere used to facilitate and/or finance the sale of the Subject Real Property,  
Defendant, and/or those Defendant controls, have reproduced, displayed and caused to

be distributed the Copyright without the permission of Plaintiff or any of the 
Copyright owners. Defendant is thus impermissibly using the Copyright to increase 
the price of the Subject Real Property, to attract buyers and in so doing Defendant is 
infringing and/or misappropriating the Copyright owners rights in the Copyright. 
26. 
By representing that a purchaser of the Subject Real Property would have 
some form of rights in or otherwise have the ability to use, or copy the Digital 
Billboard through the Concept Award, Plaintiff maintains, upon information and 
belief, that Defendant set a list price and/or negotiated a sales price for the Subject 
Real Property that is approximately double the appraised value of the Subject Real 
Property than the price Defendant identified in its publicly available pleading 
published in May 2020, in Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number 20SMCP00165. 
Defendant's reliance upon The Digital Billboard and the Copyright is impermissible.  
27. 
Plaintiff is informed and believes that Defendant has and/or will profit by 
an estimated $60,000,000.00 as a result of Defendant's wrongful reliance upon, false 
representations about and infringement of the Copyright relative to the Subject Real 
Property.  
28. 
Defendant was placed on clear notice of these issues no later than 
November 16, 2022 when Plaintiff's counsel transmitted a detailed letter to 
Defendant's counsel regarding Defendant's improper conduct and perceived 
infringement of the Copyright, as described within the foregoing paragraphs.  Within 
the November 16, 2022 letter, Plaintiff requested Defendant present evidence of a 
valid copyright license (if one existed) by November 22, 2022. In addition, Plaintiff 
advised that it required Defendant to:  
 Immediately cease representing that Defendant owns and/or has 
sufficient right to any of the design elements encompassed within the 
Copyright, or any reproductions or works derived therefrom;

 Immediately inform any buyer(s) (actual or proposed) of the Subject Real 
Property that such acquisition excludes the Copyright; 
 Immediately remove any statements from the internet, any online data 
rooms, or other digital media all claims that Defendant owns, holds or 
otherwise possesses the right to use, license or assign any element 
encompassed within the Copyright; 
 Provide the Copyright owners with a full accounting of any revenue 
Defendant has realized by using any element of the Copyright. 
29. 
On November 28, 2022, Plaintiff's counsel received a letter from 
Defendant's counsel wherein Defendant generally denies the veracity of and any 
unlawful conduct concerning the Copyright; in addition, Defendant's counsel 
presented arguments concerning the Concept Award. Missing from the November 28, 
2022 letter was the information requested in the November 16, 2022 letter.  
30. 
As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff has not received 
from Defendant (or any of Defendant's agents) any evidence of the existence of a 
valid license for Defendant's use of and reference to The Digital Billboard and 
Copyright. As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, the online sales publication 
and website continue to state, ""the City of West Hollywood has awarded 8300 Sunset 
with the ability to install digital billboard signage.""  See https://www.8300sunset.com 
(last visited Nov. 29, 2022).  No changes to Defendant's publicly accessible online 
content have been made following Plaintiff's November 16, 2022 letter. On 
information and belief, no changes have been made to the online data room or any 
other content Defendant (and/or Defendant's agents) utilizes to market or otherwise 
finance the sale or acquisition of the Subject Real Property. Thus, Defendant (and 
those Defendant controls) continues to make false representations as though 
Defendant has rights to and/or interest in the Copyright and Digital Billboard, which 
Plaintiff contends Defendant does not have. Therefore, a controversy exists as to the

effect of the Copyright on the right to construct the Digital Billboard at the Subject 
Real Property, pursuant to the award from the City of West Hollywood.  
31. 
 Plaintiff is informed and believes due to Defendant's conduct and based 
thereon alleges that Defendant will continue to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, 
exploit, and/or authorize others to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the 
Digital Billboard and the Copyright, in violation of the Copyright Act. 
32. 
 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's actions, Plaintiff will 
suffer imminent and irreparable harm, much of which cannot be reasonably or 
adequately measured or compensated in damages. Plaintiff requires judicial 
intervention in this action to determine the scope of the parties' rights relative to the 
Copyright and the Subject Real Property that Defendant owns, specifically: (1) 
Defendant does not have any rights to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, exploit, 
and/or authorize others to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the Digital 
Billboard and the Copyright because to do so would violate the Copyright Act; and (2) 
Defendant is restricted from representing to any third parties that Defendant owns or 
holds any right, title, and/or interest in the Digital Billboard and Copyright or that 
Defendant has authority to license and/or transfer any rights in or to the Digital 
Billboard or Copyright.

Plaintiff hereby incorporates each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs 1 through 32 above.

 By reason of the foregoing facts, an actual and justiciable controversy

Defendant has any right to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, exploit, and/or authorize 
others to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the Digital Billboard and the

Copyright, which Plaintiff contends Defendant has done in violation of the Copyright 
Act.  
35. 
As of the date of creation, but in no event later than November 4, 2019, 
the Copyright owners, including Plaintiff, own all rights in and to the Digital 
Billboard and the Copyright. The effective date of registration of the Copyright is July 
11, 2022; the Copyright registration decision date is November 2, 2022.  See, Exhibit 
A. 
36. 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant has no right, including no valid 
copyright license, to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, exploit, and/or authorize 
others to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the Digital Billboard and the 
Copyright. By using and referencing the Digital Billboard and Copyright (as described 
throughout this Complaint) Defendant is falsely representing to the public that 
Defendant has rights and permissions to the Digital Billboard and Copyright that do 
not exist; and, it suggests to potential purchasers of the Subject Real Property that 
acquiring the Subject Real Property will include acquisition or transfer of rights to the 
Digital Billboard and Copyright that Defendant can neither transfer nor grant.  
37. 
 Plaintiff therefore desires a judicial determination that Defendant does 
not have any rights to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, exploit, and/or authorize 
others to prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the Digital Billboard and the 
Copyright, which Plaintiff contends Defendant has done in violation of the Copyright 
Act. 
38. 
Plaintiff further desires a judicial determination that Defendant is 
restricted from representing to any third parties that Defendant owns any right, title, 
and/or interest in the Copyright or that Defendant has authority to license and/or 
transfer any rights in or to the Digital Billboard or Copyright.   
39. 
A declaration of the Court is necessary and appropriate pursuant to the 
Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 et seq., so that Plaintiff may ascertain

the Copyright, including whether Defendant and/or its agents may utilize the 
Copyright to Defendant's commercial advantage.

herein. 
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
For Injunctive Relief Against Defendant and Does 1-10 
41. 
Plaintiff hereby incorporates each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs 1 through 40 above. 
42. 
Unless enjoined and restrained by order of the Court, Defendant’s 
conduct will infringe Plaintiff’s Copyright and related interests. 
43. 
By reason of the ongoing and/or imminent copyright infringement 
against Plaintiff by Defendant, Plaintiff has sustained and, unless and until Defendant 
is enjoined, will continue to sustain substantial imminent and irreparable injury, loss 
and damage, including repeated misuse and infringement of Plaintiff’s Copyright and 
related interests. 
44. 
Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for many of its injuries in that 
such injuries cannot be reasonably, adequately, or precisely measured or compensated 
in damages if such wrongful conduct is not restrained and is allowed to continue 
unabated. Plaintiff has communicated, in detail, its concerns about Defendant's 
conduct relative to the Copyright. As of the date of this filing, Defendant has provided 
no information to Plaintiff that would establish that Defendant's conduct is lawful, 
appropriate and/or undertaken by and through a valid license. In addition, Defendant 
continues to market the Subject Real Property as described throughout this pleading, 
which includes Defendant's false representations about Defendant's ability to transfer 
rights to the Copyright by and through transfer of the Concept Award; Defendant's

references to an ability to transfer the Copyright by and through the Concept Award 
are false and third parties might conclude the language is reliable, unless this Court 
enjoins Defendant from continuing to act in this manner.  
45. 
Plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction during the pendency of 
this action and a permanent injunction ordering that Defendant, its agents, employees, 
licensees and assigns be enjoined from producing, reproducing, distributing and 
exploiting or authorizing the production, reproduction, distribution or exploitation of 
the Copyright in any manner.

prepare, produce, copy, distribute, or exploit the Digital Billboard and the Copyright; 
and (2) Defendant is restricted from representing to any third parties that Defendant 
owns any right, title, and/or interest in the Digital Billboard and Copyright or that 
Defendant has authority to license and/or transfer any rights in or to the Digital 
Billboard or Copyright.   
2. 
For an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Section 505 of the Copyright 
Act and for costs; and

13. 
On January 19, 2017, PAGE SIX ran an article that featured the Photograph on its 
web edition entitled Bobby Shmurda’s pal gets 130-year sentence, curses out judge.  See 
https://pagesix.com/2017/01/19/bobby-shmurdas-pal-gets-130-year-sentence-curses-out-judge/

licensed or otherwise authorized to reproduce, publically display, distribute and/or use the 
Photograph.  
25. 
The acts of Defendant complained of herein constitute infringement of Plaintiff’s 
copyright and exclusive rights under copyright in violation of Sections 106 and 501 of the 
Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.  
26. 
Upon information and belief, the foregoing acts of infringement by Defendant 
have been willful and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights. 
27. 
As a direct and proximate cause of the infringement by the Defendant of 
Plaintiff’s copyright and exclusive rights under copyright, Plaintiff is entitled to damages and 
defendant’s profits pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(b) for the infringement. 
28. 
Alternatively, Plaintiff is entitled to statutory damages up to $150,000 per work 
infringed for Defendant’s willful infringement of the Photograph, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). 
29.

restrained by this Court, will continue to cause Plaintiff irreparable injury that cannot be fully 
compensated by or measured in money damages.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.

NJMG’S INFRINGING ACTS – THE SPECIAL REPORT SEGMENT
19.
NJMG’s Complaint concerns an alleged act of copyright infringement arising
from the posting of a photograph to a Facebook Page associated with Bret Baier. The Complaint
was filed on or around September 19, 2014.
20.
After filing this Complaint, on or around October 14, 2014, NJMG displayed the
entirety of the Special Report Segment – one minute and fifty-three seconds in duration – on its
website, at the URL http://video.northjersey.com/Baier-Will-MSNBC-cover-Christie-
exoneration-26889890?playlistId=13994. NJMG displayed the Special Report Segment above a
large caption reading, “Baier: Will MSNBC cover Christie exoneration?” A screenshot
depicting this display of the Special Report Segment is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. NJMG
displayed the Special Report Segment without authorization from FNN.
21.
As can be seen in Exhibit A, at the top of the page on which the Special Report
Segment was displayed, there is a banner that reads “NorthJersey.com Studio.” A panel on the
right-hand side of the page features thumbnails that are said to link users to “Top Trending
Videos.” Below the Special Report Segment are thumbnails that appear to link to other videos,
sorted by categories, including “NorthJersey.com,” “Editors’ Picks,” “NJ News,” and “Must
See.”
22.
Upon information and belief, whenever a user attempted to watch the Special
Report Segment on NorthJersey.com, NJMG displayed a video advertisement for a third-party
company, typically lasting approximately 30 seconds.
23.
In the course of investigating this matter, FNN learned that the Special Report
Segment had been hosted without FNN’s permission by an entity called News Distribution
Network, Inc. (“NDN”), and displayed on an embedded video player located on NJMG’s
website. Upon information and belief, NDN is a “video automation platform [that] enables
Case 1:14-cv-07630-ER     Document 22     Filed 06/11/15     Page 12 of 22
13
publishers to optimize viewer engagement and online revenue with ease.” NDN’s published
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Copyright Infringement Notification and Counter-
Notification Procedure states that “NDN does not independently confirm that all content made
available through the NDN Sites or Services is provided by a valid rights holder.” Nevertheless,
“[i]n the event that NDN becomes aware that a person who is not a valid rights holder has
provided content published on or through an NDN Site or through a Service, NDN may, in
appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the publication of such content.”
24.
Because NDN had no authority to use or display FNN’s copyrighted content, on
October 15, 2014, FNN notified NDN of the infringement of FNN’s copyrights in the Special
Report Segment, and sent NDN a take-down notice pursuant to the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512.
Upon information and belief, NDN thereafter removed the Special Report Segment from its
servers.
25.
On March 24, 2015, FNN, through undersigned counsel herein, notified counsel
for NJMG in writing about NJMG’s unauthorized use of the Special Report Segment on its
NorthJersey.com website. In this letter, FNN informed NJMG that its display of the Special
Report Segment violated both the Copyright Act by displaying FNN’s copyrighted work, 17
U.S.C. § 106, and the Lanham Act by falsely suggesting that FNN had endorsed and/or is
affiliated with NJMG, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). No such endorsement or affiliation existed then, and
no such endorsement or affiliation exists now. Further, FNN asked NJMG to explain the “facts
and circumstances surrounding the use of the [Special Report Segment] by [NJMG], including
the date the Video first appeared on NorthJersey.com, how North Jersey obtained the Video, and
any revenues or other benefits associated with North Jersey’s use of the Video.” In the letter,
FNN also asked “whether and to what extent other [FNN] content has appeared on
Case 1:14-cv-07630-ER     Document 22     Filed 06/11/15     Page 13 of 22
14
NorthJersey.com,” and demanded that NJMG “cease its unauthorized use of [FNN’s] content and
brand, and account for its past infringements.”
26.
Neither NJMG nor its counsel responded to FNN’s letter. Instead, in early April
2015, counsel for FNN herein received a letter from Chris Camerieri, VP and General Counsel of
NDN. In that letter, NDN stated that it had “immediately removed [the Special Report Segment]
from NDN’s service” when it received the DMCA take-down notice in October. The NDN letter
did not address NJMG’s role in selecting the Special Report Segment for display, nor did it
provide any information on when the Special Report Segment first appeared on
NorthJersey.com, or whether and how NJMG generated revenue via its display of the Special
Report Segment.
27.
To this day, FNN has not received an explanation as to (1) when the Special
Report Segment first appeared on NorthJersey.com; (2) how NJMG selected the Special Report
Segment for display at http://video.northjersey.com; or (3) whether and how NJMG derived any
revenues or other benefits from its display of the Special Report Segment.
28.
Further, in early April 2015, counsel for FNN informed counsel for NJMG that
FNN had identified other unauthorized infringing uses of FNN’s copyrighted works on NJMG’s
website. However – as described below – NJMG has not removed those videos or otherwise
taken any actions to remedy those infringements.
NJMG’S INFRINGING ACTS – THE CHRISTIE-WALLACE INTERVIEW
29.
On or about October 26, 2014, NJMG displayed a portion of the Christie-Wallace
Interview on its website, at the URL http://www.northjersey.com/news/feds-press-nj-and-ny-to-
reconsider-mandatory-ebola-quarantine-policy-video-1.1118340. A screenshot depicting this
display of the Christie-Wallace Interview is annexed hereto as Exhibit B.
Case 1:14-cv-07630-ER     Document 22     Filed 06/11/15     Page 14 of 22
15
30.
As can be seen in Exhibit B, the Christie-Wallace Interview is displayed within a
news article written by NJMG “STAFF WRITERS” Jim Norman, Melissa Hayes, and Minjae
Park concerning the October 2014 New Jersey Ebola quarantine. The Christie-Wallace
Interview appears in the middle of the article, and below a sub-headline reading “Feds press NJ
and NY to reconsider mandatory Ebola quarantine policy [video].”
31.
Upon information and belief, whenever a user attempts to watch the Christie-
Wallace Interview on NorthJersey.com, NJMG displays a video advertisement for a third-party
company, typically lasting approximately 30 seconds. When displaying the Christie-Wallace
Interview, the video player gives the viewer the ability to share the video on Facebook or
Twitter, or via e-mail.
32.
NJMG posted the Christie-Wallace Interview without authorization from FNN.
33.
As of June 11, 2015, NJMG continues to display the Christie-Wallace Interview
on NorthJersey.com.
NJMG’S INFRINGING ACTS – THE POTUS SPEECH COVERAGE
34.
On or before March 26, 2015, NJMG displayed a portion of the POTUS Speech
Coverage on its website, at the URL http://video.northjersey.com/Im-pretty-sure-Ill-take-some-
actions-some-in-Congress-will-not-like-28108666, above a caption reading “I’m pretty sure I’ll
take some actions some in Congress will not like.” A screenshot depicting this display of the
POTUS Speech Coverage is annexed hereto as Exhibit C.
35.
As can be seen in Exhibit C, the NorthJersey.com page on which the POTUS
Speech Coverage appears is nearly identical to that on which the Special Report Segment
appeared. Specifically, it features a banner that reads “NorthJersey.com Studio”; it has a panel
of thumbnails on the right-hand side of the screen that link to “Top Trending Videos”; and below
Case 1:14-cv-07630-ER     Document 22     Filed 06/11/15     Page 15 of 22
16
the POTUS Speech Coverage there are thumbnails that appear to link to other videos, sorted by
categories, including “NorthJersey.com,” “Editors’ Picks,” “NJ News,” and “Must See.”
36.
Upon information and belief, whenever a user attempts to watch the POTUS
Speech Coverage on NorthJersey.com, NJMG displays a video advertisement for a third-party
company, typically lasting approximately 30 seconds. When displaying the POTUS Speech
Coverage, the video player gives the viewer the ability to share the video on Facebook or
Twitter, or via e-mail.
37.
NJMG displayed the POTUS Speech Coverage without authorization from FNN.
38.
As of June 11, 2015, NJMG continues to display the POTUS Speech Coverage on
NorthJersey.com.

68.
FNN repeats and realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 67 of this

Speech Coverage. The POTUS Speech Coverage also displays the famous and distinctive FOX
NEWS and FOX BUSINESS marks, and FNN’s FNC mark.

FURTHER ANSWER AND DEFENSE 
For and as a further answer and defense, without in anyway assuming the burden of proof 
as to any matter on which Plaintiff has the burden of proof under applicable law, or in any way 
acknowledging that Plaintiff has a valid or viable claim, Defendants state: 
1. 
On or about January 26, 2020, Plaintiff entered into an unlimited and unrestricted 
Copyright License Agreement (“License”) for the use, marketing, promotion, distribution, 
copying, reproduction, display and electronic publication of the Sowers Photo, including the right 
to modify and alter the Sowers Photo. 
2.  
Pursuant to that License, the Sowers Photo was used and displayed in an 
advertisement for Microsoft® that was telecast during the 2020 National Football League Super 
Bowl®. The advertisement, called “Be The One” (“BTO Ad”) was about National Football League 
coach, Katie Sowers, and her achievement as one of the first female NFL coaches and the first 
female to coach at a Super Bowl®. In accordance with the License, the Sowers Photograph was 
displayed at about the 40 second mark of the BTO Ad without attribution or other information. 
Case 4:21-cv-00557-RK     Document 28     Filed 10/08/21     Page 126 of 130
 
127 
3. 
In addition to the Super Bowl® telecast, the BTO Ad was published on YouTube 
and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHcI4xPR_k. 
4. 
Through YouTube, Microsoft and its advertising agency submitted the BTO Ad 
with the Sowers Photo to Gannett and USAToday for use and display in their AdMeter Program 
pursuant to the License Plaintiff granted. 
5. 
The AdMeter program was started in 1989 and gauges consumers’ opinions about 
television’s most expensive commercials, those that run during the Super Bowl®. Since then, the 
results have become the industry-leading tool used to measure public opinion surrounding Super 
Bowl® ads. Thousands of persons register and participate to express their opinions and evaluations 
about the Super Bowl® advertisements submitted. 
6. 
In 2020, along with the BTO Ad, the AdMeter program included 62 advertisements 
and had more than 20,000 registered voters. The BTO Ad place ninth. 
First Defense (License) 
 
7. 
For the reasons expressed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, each of which are 
incorporated herein by reference, among others, Plaintiff’s claims are barred in that Defendants’ 
use was with license and permission. 
Second Defense (Fair Use 17 U.S.C § 107) 
 
8. 
For the reasons expressed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, each of which are 
incorporated herein by reference, among others, Plaintiff’s claims are barred in whole or in part 
by the doctrine of fair use as found at 17 U.S.C. § 107. To the extent the Sowers Photo was used 
as a screen shot for linking to and viewing the BTO Ad, Defendants’ use was transformative in 
that it was used as a vehicle for commentary and evaluation about the BTO Ad wherein the Sowers 
Photo was displayed with Plaintiff’s permission and license. 
Case 4:21-cv-00557-RK     Document 28     Filed 10/08/21     Page 127 of 130
 
128 
Third Defense (Implied Consent) 
9. 
For the reasons expressed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, each of which are 
incorporated herein by reference, among others, Plaintiff has impliedly consented to Defendants’ 
publication and her claims should be barred as a result. 
Fourth Defense (Invalid Registration) 
 
 
10. 
Plaintiff’s claims are barred in whole or in part to the extent the registration of the 
works with the United States Copyright Office is invalid or unenforceable or to the extent Plaintiff 
failed to register copyright in the Sowers Photo before commencement of this action or within 
three months of first publication as required under 17 U.S.C. § 412. 
Fifth Defense (Innocent Infringement) 
 
11. 
The facts set forth in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, each of which are incorporated 
herein by reference, refute any claim that the Defendants intentionally removed copyright 
management information or willfully infringed Plaintiff’s copyright.  Further, there is no merit to 
Plaintiff’s allegation that Defendants continue to display the photograph, in that Defendants 
removed the photograph from any location where it would be readily displayed or perceived by 
the public upon being advised of Plaintiff’s claims and before this lawsuit was filed. As such, 
assuming Plaintiff can maintain any claim for copyright infringement, which Defendants deny, 
such infringement was innocent and not willful as alleged.   
Reservation of Right to Assert Additional Defenses 
 
22. 
Defendants reserve the right to assert additional defenses as may become apparent 
as the litigation proceeds.

that Judgment be entered in their favor, and that they be awarded their costs and attorneys’ fees 
incurred herein.
